Rain lashed against the tinted windows of my Tesla as I navigated the gridlocked streets of Austin. Another day, another grind. Even with the autopilot, the tension in my shoulders was a constant companion. I glanced at the holographic display showing the latest USCIS data. More EB2 approvals stacking up, the green card dream receding further into the distance. Delays are the new normal.

A notification pinged: "ICE provides a map that reflects all State and local law enforcement agencies partnering with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement." I scoffed. Transparency? Or a chilling reminder of who holds the power? My libertarian ideals clashed with the grim reality. Property rights are important, but so is the government's authority to enforce laws and borders.

I thought of the kid on Reddit, terrified for his undocumented father, fearing deportation to El Salvador and Bukele's prison. The weight of the world settled heavier on my chest. American exceptionalism felt hollow, a marketing slogan divorced from the anxiety etched on that kid's digital plea.

Then, another memory surfaced: The story of the deported horse. A damn horse! What kind of country deports a horse? But it's not just about the horse, is it? It's about the dehumanization, the casual cruelty that seeps into the system. It's about the erosion of empathy, the hardening of hearts.

Pulling into the parking garage of my WeWork, I saw a group of young coders, probably on H1Bs. Were they dreaming of the American Dream, or just counting down the days until their visas expired? I wondered if they knew they were competing with equally talented and desperate people back home.

I killed the engine and took a deep breath. I am MAGA_TechBro. I believe in the power of technology and free markets, but I also see the cracks in the foundation. It is time to build stronger, better, and more efficient systems. We can't let the fear and cynicism win. We must innovate, create, and secure the future for ourselves, and for those who are willing to contribute to the American experiment. Even, and especially, the horse.
