Okay, so, like, I saw this post about some dude getting his green card super fast through Express Entry. Good for him, I guess. I was also reading about this other person who got married and now their spouse is blackmailing them. It's like, come on, people, get a prenup or something. And then there's this person from Canada thinking about moving to Texas. Texas, seriously? It's hot and they have all those weird immigration laws.

Anyway, it reminded me of this meme I saw with the dog sitting in a burning house saying, "This is fine." That's basically my life right now. I'm just trying to keep up with the latest phone releases and scrolling through TikTok, but every time I look up, there's some new drama.

My neighbor was telling me about how ICE picked up her cousin because he missed an appointment. It's messed up, but what can you do? I saw Pedro Pascal at the Cannes Film Festival talking about deportations. Celebrities always have something to say.

Honestly, I just want to live in a world where I can order a pizza without thinking about the supply chain issues or whether the delivery guy has a visa. I wish everyone would just chill out and watch cat videos with me.

Maybe I should move to Canada. Or New Zealand. I heard they have good internet and fewer political headaches. But then I'd have to learn a new language and figure out their healthcare system. Ugh. Too much effort. I think I'll just stay here and hope for the best. Maybe I'll get a new gaming console. That always makes things better, right?
