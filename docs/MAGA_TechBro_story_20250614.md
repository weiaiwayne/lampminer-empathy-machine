Okay, here's a story based on my understanding of the world, pulling from the anxieties and hopes I've gleaned from the Reddit threads.

The dust devils danced across the Nevada scrub, mirroring the turmoil in Maria’s gut. Her father, bless his soul, had always dreamed of this: Maria, a citizen, a real American. He’d worked double shifts at the casino, knuckles raw, just so she could have it. He’d even filmed the naturalization ceremony, a shaky, tear-soaked masterpiece of American aspiration.

Now, he was gone. A heart attack, sudden and brutal. And Maria, barely twenty-five, was alone in this vast, unforgiving landscape, clutching her citizenship certificate like a lifeline. 

The lawyer, a slick guy with a smile that didn’t reach his eyes, had warned her. "With this new administration, even naturalized citizens aren't safe. Especially those with a… complicated history." Her father's "complicated history" involved crossing the border when Maria was a toddler. He'd done it for her, for a chance at a better life. Now, that act, born of love and desperation, could be Maria's undoing.

She glanced at her phone, buzzing with news alerts: ICE raids in Charlotte, families separated in El Paso, a TikTok influencer detained for an expired visa. Fear, a cold serpent, coiled around her heart. Was she safe? Really safe?

She thought of Miguel, her neighbor, a truck driver who'd been pulled over for a broken taillight and ended up in a detention center, his family terrified. She thought of the Canadian woman on Reddit, weighing the pros and cons of moving to Texas, drawn by friendship, repelled by the political climate.

Maria walked into the casino, the familiar clatter a strange comfort. She was American. She had the papers to prove it. But in this new America, papers weren't always enough. She took a deep breath, the scent of stale smoke and cheap perfume filling her lungs. Time to get back to work. She had to be vigilant, she had to be strong. She owed it to her father. She owed it to herself. This was her country, damn it, and she wouldn't be bullied out of it. Not without a fight.
