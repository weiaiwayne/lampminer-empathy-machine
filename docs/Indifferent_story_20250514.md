Okay, so, like, I saw this thing on Reddit about how they're sending *white* South Africans here as refugees. Afrikaners, right? Seems kinda sus, TBH. I mean, aren't we supposed to be, like, *against* apartheid? My brain is overheating.

Then there's this whole thing about deporting this cancer patient, a kid even! What the actual frick? I'm just trying to watch cat videos and someone is out there being a supervillain. 

And don't even get me STARTED on the job market. This second-gen immigrant was complaining about working 60 hours a week in a toxic environment. I'm in tech, I should be chilling, but instead I'm reading about people getting discriminated against and grinding themselves to dust. Is this the "American Dream?" More like the "American Nightmare" amirite?

Also, that post about stress-free work environments? YES! Elon Musk is just a greedy dude chasing power. Like, can't we just chill and enjoy the memes?

I saw a post about someone just wanting to chill in Canada after a trip to Cuba but might get hassled for it in the US. I was like "lol, just get a VPN duh".

I'm just trying to save up for the new VR headset, ya know? Escape this dumpster fire of a world. But then I see all this crap, and I'm like, "Is there even a point?" Maybe I'll just go back to scrolling through r/aww. Puppies can't deport you, right?
