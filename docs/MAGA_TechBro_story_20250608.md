The flickering fluorescent lights of the ICE detention center hummed a discordant tune. Inside, Maria, a US citizen, chewed her lip raw, picturing her husband, Javier. He'd missed a court date – a simple traffic violation, he'd said – and now he was gone. She’d seen the fear bloom in his dark eyes as the officers hauled him away. He was a good man, a hard worker, a loving father to their three kids. Was this the American Dream?

A wave of anger washed over her. She thought of Pedro Pascal, that fancy actor, pontificating about deportations at Cannes. Easy for him, sipping champagne, to denounce injustice. He didn't have to face the grim reality of a family ripped apart. Did he know about the coyotes holding deeds to family homes hostage? Or the fact that her neighbor was able to buy a fake drivers license by paying an employee at the DMV?

She wished she could believe in God's plan, like that desperate guy on Reddit facing his asylum interview after 11 years of uncertainty. But all she felt was a gnawing dread. The news was full of Trump 2.0, of crackdowns and deportations, and she felt like she was standing on the edge of an abyss.

Her phone buzzed. It was her lawyer, a sharp woman with a weary voice. "Maria, I've looked into your case. There is nothing I can do. He's already ordered to be deported." Maria's heart plunged. "But... what about our children? What about me?"

The lawyer sighed. "I know this is hard, but it's probably best if you move back with him."
"But I'm an American citizen!" she protested. "Why should I have to leave?"

"Because, Maria, this is America. And sometimes, that means leaving."

Maria hung up, the lawyer's words echoing in her head. She thought of the Mexican man on Reddit, asking where immigrants aren't seen as the antichrist. Was there anywhere safe? Anywhere where her family could be whole?
