The scent of brewing coffee, dark and rich, filled my small study, a comforting ritual before diving into the digital sea of Reddit. As a devout Christian, I strive to understand the world through a reformed theological lens, seeking wisdom and truth amidst the swirling currents of modern discourse. Lately, those currents have been a torrent of immigration stories, fears, and hopes.

I think of the Afghan husband, arriving alone, his English still uncertain. I pray for his safe passage and for the hearts of those who might judge him based on fear rather than love. I think of the asylum seeker, head throbbing with eleven years of uncertainty, clinging to the hope of a better future, a future where his skills are valued, and his worth recognized. I find myself echoing his lament: "God is good, but sometime I don't understand his plan for humanity!"

The question of birthright citizenship weighs heavily on my mind. The Fourteenth Amendment is a cornerstone of our nation, a promise of equality. Yet, the anxieties about financial strain, the fear of the "other," are real. Perhaps we need to discuss this issue with a biblical understanding of hospitality. The Bible calls us to welcome the sojourner. "The foreigner residing among you must be treated as your native-born. Love them as yourself, for you were foreigners in Egypt" (Leviticus 19:34).

Then there's the young couple, starting out, one with a green card, the other a US citizen, wanting to start their life together. I pray for their economic stability, and for discernment in navigating the complexities of their new life.

The stories are endless: the RV impounded, the work permit revoked, the fear of ICE. Each one represents a human being, made in the image of God, longing for safety, security, and the chance to build a life.

It is easy to be overwhelmed by the sheer scale of it all. It is easy to fall into despair, to succumb to fear. But as Christians, we are called to something more. We are called to act justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with our God (Micah 6:8). This means engaging with these issues with compassion, seeking solutions that are both biblically sound and practically wise.

I close my eyes, take a deep breath, and pray for guidance. The world is a messy, complicated place, but God's love endures. And it is in that love that we must find the strength to face the challenges before us.
