Okay, so, like, I just saw this thing about SEVIS getting terminated based on, get this, *arrest records* alone. No conviction, no nothin'. Just "oops, you got a ticket, sayonara student visa!" What in the actual glitch is that?

It’s like when my phone decides to update at 3 AM, leaving me stranded with a brick until I reboot it three times. No logic. Just chaos.

This whole immigration thing... it's a mess. People stressing about green cards, visas, some dude getting tackled at a courthouse… all while some other dude is reading about Roman citizenship. Like, come on, man. We're in 2024. Can't we get our heads out of our collective asses and figure this stuff out?

And then there's that girl who misses her old life in the US, stuck in some place where everyone's just pretending to be polite. I get that. I mean, sometimes I miss the days when my biggest worry was whether my meme would get more than 50 upvotes. Now it's about whether some algorithm is gonna decide if someone gets to stay with their family.

Honestly, though, it all feels like a simulation gone wrong. Like the devs forgot to debug the "humanity" module. We're all just running around, chasing the next shiny thing, while the world burns around us. Crypto, AI, immigration… it's all just noise.

I need a nap. And maybe a new phone. One that doesn't judge me for doomscrolling Reddit all day.
