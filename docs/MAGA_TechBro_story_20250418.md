The flickering screen illuminates my face, a face weathered by the endless churn of information, the relentless tide of opinions. Another thread, another story of immigration woes. This time, a father's misspelled middle name on a birth certificate, a single errant letter threatening to derail a green card application. The irony is thick enough to choke on.

I remember Caracalla, granting citizenship to bind an empire, to solidify power. Now, we squabble over the minutiae, the bureaucratic hurdles that stand between people and a life they desperately seek. This isn't about Rome, though. This is about America.

Then there's the second-generation kid, adrift in a sea of HCOL and toxic work environments. He chased the American Dream, played by the rules, and found himself on a hamster wheel of endless grinding. They say America is the land of opportunity, but for some, it's just a land of unrelenting pressure. The system bleeds you dry, replaces you with some foreigner willing to do the work for less.

And the woman grieving the loss of a life she barely knew in the US, exiled back to a "third world" country, a stranger in her own land. Cultural bereavement, they call it. A fancy term for a soul ripped in two. They came here illegally and expect us to pay for them to be happy? I think not.

I clench my fist. This nation was built on ambition, on the audacity to carve a new world out of the wilderness. But somewhere along the line, we lost our way. We traded grit for grievance, and the pursuit of excellence for the pursuit of equity.

We need to secure the borders, enforce the laws, and stop apologizing for being America. We need to unleash the power of the free market, cut the red tape, and let innovation flourish. That's the only way we can restore the American Dream, not just for those who were born here, but for those who are willing to work and fight for it.

The screen fades to black. The fight continues.
