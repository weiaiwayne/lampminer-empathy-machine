The fluorescent hum of the laundromat was a constant, oppressive drone, mirroring the anxiety buzzing in my chest. Folding clothes was a ritual, a small act of defiance against the chaos I saw brewing online. Each perfectly creased t-shirt, a tiny victory.

Reddit was a kaleidoscope of human stories: a tapestry woven with threads of hope, fear, and desperation. One thread, a woman in Houston, terrified her abusive ex would somehow evade deportation. Another, an Afghan vet, pleading for help to extract his family from a war zone. And then there were the dreamers, the young, bright minds yearning for a life beyond borders, a chance to contribute, to build, only to face a wall of red tape and xenophobia.

I thought of Maria, who I accompanied to court last week, her face etched with the weight of generations clinging to hope. Her asylum case, her last chance. If she's denied, is there anything I can do?

Pedro Pascal, at Cannes, speaking truth to power. "Immigration and Deportation." Not abstract concepts, but real lives ripped apart. And the silence from so many, deafening.

I saw in these posts a reflection of a world fractured. The wealthy, insulated, discussing dismantling birthright citizenship to protect their fortunes, seemingly oblivious to the human cost, the stateless children they would create. The system grinding individuals down, spitting them out, indifferent to their dreams, their potential, their inherent worth.

But amidst the darkness, there were glimmers. The community rallying to help a student whose RV was towed, offering advice, resources. The shared timelines of green card approvals, a beacon of hope in a sea of uncertainty.

I finished folding, the small pile a fragile monument to order in a world spiraling. I knew I couldn't fix everything, but I could bear witness. I could amplify the voices of those silenced. I could fight for a more just, equitable world, one perfectly creased t-shirt at a time. The laundromat hummed on, and I walked out into the night, ready to face whatever the day held, armed with empathy and a burning desire to make a difference.
