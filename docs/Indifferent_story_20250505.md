Okay, lemme spin a yarn based on all this Reddit drama.

The recycling bin overflowed, a monument to discarded Amazon boxes and half-eaten microwave meals. Rain lashed against the window, mirroring the torrent of anxieties scrolling through my feed. Some dude's MIL calling the cops on his FIL, immigration nightmares, families ripped apart...and then some other guy charting the trajectory of green card approvals like it's the stock market. What a mess.

I clicked on a meme of Doge captioned, "Me trying to understand US immigration law." Accurate. My phone buzzed, a notification from Temu: "Electric Lint Remover - 70% OFF!" Distraction achieved.

But the underlying unease lingered. It wasn't just the abstract political stuff. It was the *real* people behind the headlines. The au pair stressing about a visa renewal, the desperate pleas for pro bono lawyers, the fear in a kid's voice worried about their deported parent. It was the constant, low-grade hum of uncertainty that seemed to permeate everything. Like, are we all just one wrong form, one missed deadline, away from disaster?

I thought about that 2nd gen American, grinding away, 60-hour weeks, still getting side-eyed. And then the horse that got deported. A *horse*. What kind of Kafkaesque hellscape is this?

I sighed, cracked open a can of La Croix (Pamplemousse, naturally), and scrolled through TikTok. A dude was reviewing a new VR headset. Shiny. Distracting.

But even as I watched him virtually swing a lightsaber, the faces from Reddit flickered in my mind. The woman forced into a safe house after the government doxxed her. The kid with cancer, deported. The horse.

The VR headset guy was raving about the immersive experience. I wondered if you could use it to escape all this. Probably not. Reality, like a persistent pop-up ad, always finds a way. Maybe I'll just buy that lint remover. At least that's something I can control. Probably.
