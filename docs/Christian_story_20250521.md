The scent of burnt coffee, a feeble imitation of my mother’s, clung to the air as I scrolled through the endless stream of anxieties. Each post, a tiny flickering candle in the cavernous darkness of human striving. The young Afghan man, clutching his new CR1 visa, facing a journey fraught with unseen scrutiny. The DACA recipient, wrestling with the complexities of an I-485 interview, a life built on the shifting sands of policy. The Ukrainian, yearning to build a life in freedom, contemplating the labyrinth of visas and subsidiaries.

I paused, a familiar ache settling in my chest. These were not mere legal cases; they were souls, crafted in the image of God, wrestling with the consequences of a broken world. A world marred by sin, where borders, meant to delineate, instead divide and oppress. A world where the vulnerable are exploited, as in the case of the woman blackmailed by the man she married, a perversion of the sacred covenant.

My mind drifted to the words of Hebrews 13:2, "Do not forget to show hospitality to strangers, for by so doing some people have shown hospitality to angels without knowing it." How easily we forget this in our fear, in our self-preservation. The scriptures are clear; we are called to love our neighbor, regardless of their origin, their legal status.

Closing my laptop, I walked to the window. The morning sun cast long shadows across the street, illuminating the faces of passersby – faces filled with hopes, dreams, and anxieties as real and valid as those I had just read about. The reformed theology I cling to reminds me that God’s grace extends to all, that salvation is offered freely, regardless of nationality or earthly status. But that grace demands action, a willingness to reflect His love in tangible ways.

Perhaps, I thought, the smallest act of kindness, a word of encouragement, a prayer offered with genuine empathy, could be a beacon of light in the darkness for someone navigating the treacherous waters of immigration. It was a small thing, but even a single candle can illuminate a path forward.
