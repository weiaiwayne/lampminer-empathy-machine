The flickering neon sign of "Kim's Groceries" cast a sickly green glow on the rain-slicked street. Inside, Mrs. Kim, her face etched with a roadmap of worry, meticulously stacked ramen packets. She'd been here for forty years, a silent fixture in this corner of Queens, a whispered promise of a better life realized. But the promise felt tarnished now, fraying at the edges like the worn linoleum floor.

Her grandson, Daniel, fresh out of NYU with a degree in environmental science, scrolled through Reddit on his phone, his brow furrowed. He was haunted by the story of the Venezuelan man tackled in the courthouse, the sheer brutality of it a stark reminder of the precarity of existence for so many. He saw it in the faces of the day laborers huddled on the corner, in the hurried glances of the undocumented delivery drivers zipping past.

"Halmeoni," he said, using the Korean word for grandmother, "did you see what happened to that man in New Hampshire?"

Mrs. Kim sighed, a sound like air escaping a punctured tire. "America is a hard place, Daniel. Always has been. Always will be for people like us."

He wanted to argue, to tell her about Caracalla's edict and the potential for inclusivity, about the inherent injustice of a system that valued some lives more than others. But the words caught in his throat. He knew the truth: the system wasn't broken, it was functioning exactly as it was designed to.

He thought of his friend, struggling to navigate the labyrinthine immigration laws, the constant fear of deportation a shadow that clung to her every move. He thought of the young DACA recipient, weighing the impossible choice of enlisting in the military to protect his parents. How could a nation demand such a sacrifice?

Daniel looked at his grandmother, her hands calloused from years of hard work, her eyes filled with a quiet resilience that defied the weight of her experiences. He knew he couldn't shield her from the harsh realities of this world, but he could fight for a future where her sacrifices, and the sacrifices of countless others, weren't in vain.

He closed his laptop, the cool metal a sharp contrast to the burning anger in his chest. "Let's close up shop, Halmeoni. I'll walk you home." The rain had stopped, and a sliver of moon peeked through the clouds, offering a fragile, fleeting hope. The fight, he knew, was just beginning.
