The flickering neon sign of the "Golden Opportunity Immigration Services" cast a sickly yellow glow across my face as I scrolled through Reddit. Caracalla's Edict echoed in my mind – a promise of inclusion, a pragmatic grab for power. But the comments sections screamed a different story: second-generation disillusionment, migratory grief blooming in the sterile soil of the American dream, anxieties over H1B visas, the gnawing fear of deportation.

A young woman's desperate plea for her father, a Salvadoran mechanic with a cross tattoo, haunted me. Cecot. The word pulsed with a primal fear, a chilling reminder of the brutal reality behind the polished facade of progress. Trump and Bukele, two sides of the same coin, grinding the vulnerable under their heels.

Then, the story of the Venezuelan man tackled in a courthouse. Zero empathy. The phrase stuck in my throat. How easily the system could crush you, regardless of your story, your dreams, your humanity.

I saw myself in these digital cries for help. The weight of inherited trauma, the pressure to succeed, the constant awareness of my otherness – it all coalesced into a dull ache in my chest. Was this the promised land? A place where ambition was rewarded with burnout, where belonging was a performance, where your legal status could be yanked away on a whim?

No. It couldn't be.

Caracalla's edict wasn't just about citizenship; it was about shared destiny. We needed to build a system that lived up to that ideal. One that prioritized human rights over political expediency, that offered genuine pathways to belonging, that recognized the inherent dignity of every person, regardless of their origin.

I closed my laptop, the neon sign still pulsing outside. The fight for justice was a long one, a messy one. But it was a fight worth fighting. The digital cries had to turn into real action, into policy changes, into a society where empathy wasn't a luxury, but a fundamental principle. The ghosts of Rome were watching. The future was listening.
