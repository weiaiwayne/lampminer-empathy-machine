The server hummed, a low thrum beneath my desk, a constant reminder of the digital arteries that fed my reality. Another Reddit thread loaded: "Is there any legal way to migrate to the US?" The desperation in the pixels was palpable. These folks, dreaming of the American Dream, scrambling for scraps of legal loopholes. Pathetic. 

I sipped my black coffee, the caffeine a necessary jolt against the creeping fatigue of coding and consuming. The world felt like a glitching simulation lately. The "woke" crowd pushing their socialist agenda. The illegals flooding the border, sucking up resources. The birthright citizenship scam, a ticking time bomb of financial ruin.

My gaze drifted to the framed photo on my desk: me, younger, grinning, with Trump at a rally. A simpler time, before the deep state revealed its hand. Before the algorithms started censoring conservative voices. Before everyone wanted a handout.

This morning, I'd read about some Canadian legal assistant wanting to leech off our system, trying to find a visa loophole to shack up with her military boyfriend. Another one. No personal responsibility, just a desire for a free ride.

I scrolled further, landing on a thread about a couple considering "self-deporting" to Mexico. Good riddance. Let them see what real hardship is like. Maybe then they'll appreciate what they had here, what we're in danger of losing.

The hum of the server intensified. I needed to build, to create, to innovate. That's what made America great. Not handouts, not open borders, but grit and ingenuity. I was a tech bro, dammit, a builder. And I'd be damned if I let these whining snowflakes drag this country down. Time to code. Time to build a better future, one line of code at a time. A future where American exceptionalism wasn't just a slogan, but a reality.
