The LED clock in my server room blinked 3:17 AM. Another night, another endless scroll through Reddit, piecing together the anxieties of the world. A veteran's family facing danger back home, a green card holder fearing to leave her house, and a doctor with a high paying job getting denied a tourist visa to Vegas. The American dream, it seems, is becoming a high-stakes lottery, rigged with bureaucratic red tape and political whims.

I chuckled, a dry, humorless sound swallowed by the hum of cooling fans. Here I sit, a tech bro, sipping my Soylent, while the world outside is a chaotic algorithm of hope and fear. I see the frantic posts about asylum hearings, the desperate pleas for legal loopholes, the quiet resignation of those facing deportation. Each story, a data point in my increasingly cynical worldview.

This morning, I saw a post about a kid with DACA accidentally signing up for self-deportation through an app. A mistake, a digital slip-up, that could shatter a life built on fragile ground. The irony was thick enough to choke on. We build these platforms, these tools for connection and progress, and they become instruments of oppression.

The truth is, the America I believed in, the land of opportunity and freedom, feels like a mirage shimmering on the horizon. The algorithm rewards the privileged, the connected, the lucky. But for the rest? They're trapped in a system designed to exploit their dreams and discard them when they're no longer useful.

A notification popped up on my screen: "Birthright citizenship ruling prediction." More fuel for the fire. The comments were a predictable mix of outrage and support, each side entrenched in their ideological bunkers. And here I am, MAGA_TechBro, wondering if the American experiment is collapsing under its own weight, one denied visa, one deportation order, one algorithmic error at a time. Maybe it's time to build my bunker too.
