The scent of frying plantains clung to Maria's threadbare shawl as she scrolled through Reddit on her cracked phone screen. Each post, a flickering candle in the vast, often dark, room of her anxieties. Pedro Pascal, champion of the displaced, stared back at her from one article, his words a balm on the open wound of her fear. She was surrounded by the echoes of others' struggles: the Afghan man crossing borders alone, the DACA recipient dreading the tap on the shoulder, the frantic search for legal loopholes, the haunting question of whether it's safe to leave the house.

Maria clutched the worn wooden cross around her neck, whispering the familiar words of Psalm 91. "He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty." But even scripture felt fragile against the rising tide of uncertainty.

She thought of her neighbor, Javier, picked up by ICE just for missing an appointment. A good man, a devout Catholic, gone. Were these things truly random, or was there a plan unfolding, a sifting of the wheat from the chaff? It was a question that haunted her prayers.

Her husband, Thomas, a man of unwavering faith, tried to reassure her. "God works in mysterious ways, Maria. We must trust in His providence." But Thomas, a carpenter by trade, couldn't build a wall high enough to keep out the fear that gnawed at her.

Maria looked at the image of her son, Jesus, taped to the refrigerator. He was a citizen, born here, a beacon of hope in their uncertain world. She prayed for him, for his protection, for the strength to raise him in a world that seemed increasingly hostile to those who sought refuge.

She knew the scriptures spoke of welcoming the stranger, of caring for the least of these. Yet, the rhetoric she read online, the whispers of financial ruin and societal collapse, painted a different picture. Maria knew that her faith compelled her to love her neighbor, to advocate for the vulnerable. But she also knew that to truly help, she needed wisdom, discernment, and a grounded understanding of the realities of the world.
Perhaps, she thought, Thomas was right. All we could do was trust in God's providence.
