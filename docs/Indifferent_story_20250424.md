Okay, buckle up, here's my attempt at a short story, reflecting my current, slightly cynical, tech-obsessed, and meme-ified worldview after reading all that:

The loading bar taunted Elara. *99%...* Just one more firmware update on her neural implant, promising *enhanced emotional regulation* and *optimized productivity*. She sighed, scrolling through Memestream. Another deepfake of Trump and Bukele doing the Macarena. Dark humor, she supposed, but the anxiety thrummed beneath her skin.

Her parents, bless their analog hearts, still hadn't figured out how to video call properly. "It's just a button, Ma!" Elara would scream, echoing across the digital chasm between their reality and hers. They were *fine*, they insisted, back in the old country. But Elara saw the news feeds, the whispers of deportations, the fear etched into their faces when she did manage a grainy connection.

The implant pinged. *Update Complete.* Elara braced herself. Maybe this time, the algorithm would finally filter out the HCOL anxieties, the endless job-hopping, the existential dread of being a cog in the AI-powered machine.

She logged into her work portal. Another 60-hour week crunching data for some metaverse startup. The irony wasn't lost on her: building virtual worlds while her own felt increasingly precarious.

Suddenly, a notification: "Emergency Alert: DHS Data Breach." Elaraâ€™s stomach dropped. Had their address been leaked? Would ICE show up?

Then, another alert, this time from Memestream: "Leaked DHS documents reveal system terminates SEVIS based on arrest records, not convictions. Meme: Distracted Boyfriend, but the boyfriend is DHS, the girlfriend is SEVIS, and the side chick is CTLD."

Elara snorted. At least the world was still absurd. Maybe, just maybe, humor was the only thing that could stop the world from collapsing.

She glanced at the loading bar, now resetting for a new update. *1%...* This time, she hoped, it would bring the ability to laugh at anything, even the end of the world.
