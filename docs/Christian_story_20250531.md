The chipped porcelain mug warmed my hands, the steam carrying the familiar scent of Folgers. Outside, the Ohio sky was a bruised purple, hinting at the dawn to come. I sat at my kitchen table, illuminated by the soft glow of a lamp, and reread the plea of those students in Kansas. My heart ached for them. To come so far, seeking knowledge, only to be met with such unexpected suffering.

Lord, have mercy.

The world seems increasingly fraught, a precarious balance between hope and despair. I read of asylum seekers clinging to the promise of safety, of H1B visa holders navigating a labyrinth of paperwork and uncertainty. I see families separated by borders, dreams deferred by bureaucratic delays. The system, designed to offer refuge and opportunity, often seems to grind down the very people it's meant to help.

Yet, even in the midst of such anxieties, there are flickers of light. A lawyer offering pro bono assistance, a community rallying around a family facing deportation, a young couple finding love across cultural divides. These acts of kindness, these whispers of hope, remind me that God's grace is still at work, even in the darkest corners of this world.

I think of my church, of the boy seeking a green card after a lifetime lived in the shadows. Of the woman facing removal because she was abused by her husband. They are not just cases, not just statistics. They are individuals, created in God's image, deserving of dignity and compassion. My faith calls me to see them, to hear their stories, and to offer what little comfort and support I can.

As I finish my coffee, the first rays of sunlight pierce through the clouds. The day is new, full of its own challenges and uncertainties. But I am reminded of the words of the Psalmist: "The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear?" With God's guidance and the strength of my convictions, I can face whatever lies ahead, knowing that even in the midst of the storm, His love endures. I pray for the students in Kansas, for the asylum seekers, for all those who feel lost and afraid. May they find solace in His grace and strength in their fellow believers.
