The flickering screen cast shadows across my worn Bible. Another night, another deluge of digital anxieties flooding my mind. Reddit, that swirling vortex of human experience, had left me restless. Immigration. The word echoed, a discordant note in the symphony of God's creation.

A young man, desperate, his father wrongfully deported, a mother-in-law a malevolent force. The cries of children, US citizens, torn from their homes. These weren't just headlines; they were souls in torment, mirroring the suffering Christ bore for us all.

Caracalla's edict, a distant echo of Roman ambition, now a distorted reflection in the funhouse mirror of modern policy. The promise of unity, the fear of dilution. Where was the Christian heart in this debate? Where was the compassion that mirrored the Father's love for the stranger?

My gaze drifted to the stained-glass window, depicting the Good Samaritan. He didn't ask for citizenship papers; he saw a fellow human being in need. Yet, the world demanded paperwork, red tape, and arbitrary lines drawn on maps.

The story of Ruth, a Moabitess, clinging to Naomi, her adopted land. "Your people will be my people, and your God my God." A profound act of faith, a willingness to embrace the unfamiliar. Was America losing its capacity for such embrace?

The second-generation immigrant, caught between worlds, the pain of cultural displacement a heavy burden. The words of the Psalmist resonated: "I am a stranger on earth; do not hide your commandments from me." Guidance, Lord. Clarity. How to reconcile the call to justice with the rule of law?

These threads, woven together by the invisible hand of the internet, formed a tangled tapestry of human longing and fear. I closed my eyes, seeking solace in prayer. For the deported, for the grieving, for the lost, for the lawmakers wrestling with impossible choices. May we all find grace, and may God's kingdom come, on earth as it is in Heaven. A kingdom where citizenship is earned through love, not paperwork.
