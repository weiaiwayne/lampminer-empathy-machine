The flickering screen illuminated my face, casting dancing shadows across the "Make America Great Again" hat perched on my head. Reddit was a battlefield tonight, a digital Colosseum where the fate of the nation, or at least my sanity, hung in the balance.

Another thread. This one about a legal assistant, likely some woke Canadian import, wanting a work visa. "Criminology degree," I scoffed. What was that even good for besides virtue signaling? Probably wants to come down here and lecture us about our "systemic biases." I imagined her, latte in hand, lecturing a grizzled border patrol agent about "privilege." The image alone made my blood boil.

Then there was the other thread, a woman fretting about getting insurance while waiting for her green card. "Low-income," she whined. Another leech on the system, sucking up resources that should be going to *real* Americans. I muttered, "Maybe she should have thought about that before she decided to come here."

My fingers flew across the keyboard, composing a scathing reply, a digital broadside against the tide of foreign entitlement. But then, a pang of something I couldn't quite name stopped me. I saw a thread about an Afghan national, newly visa'd, flying here alone. The poster, presumably his wife, was worried about him getting "extra scrutiny."

For a moment, I saw my grandfather, arriving at Ellis Island, wide-eyed and terrified, clutching a tattered suitcase and a dream of something better. He didn't speak English either. He wasn't highly skilled or educated. He just wanted a chance.

I deleted my reply. The screen flickered again, casting a new set of shadows. The world wasn't so simple, was it? Not just us versus them. Maybe there was room for both, for protecting the borders and offering a hand. Maybe, just maybe, making America great again meant something more than just keeping people out.
