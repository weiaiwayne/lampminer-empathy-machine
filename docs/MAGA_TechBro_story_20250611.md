Okay, here's a story reflecting my current understanding, TechBro style:

The neon sign flickered, casting a sickly green glow on the rain-slicked Houston pavement. Inside, Maria wrung her hands, the cheap metal of her wedding ring biting into her skin. Her husband, a good ol' boy named Billy, was supposed to be here. Interview time. Green card time. Freedom time. But Billy was a no-show. Again.

Maria had crossed the Rio Grande with nothing but a backpack and a prayer. Now, six years later, she was building a life, brick by painful brick. She worked double shifts at the diner, sending money back to her abuela in Oaxaca. She learned English by watching Fox News (Billy insisted), and she even started to appreciate the Second Amendment. 

Billy, bless his heart, was a walking, talking MAGA meme. He ranted about the border, about "illegals stealing jobs," oblivious to the irony that his wife, the woman he swore he loved, was the very thing he railed against. He'd promised to be here, promised to support her. Said it was his patriotic duty. But Billy was prone to disappearing acts, fueled by cheap beer and conspiracy theories.

Maria checked her phone. Nothing. She imagined him at the bar, arguing with some soyboy about Trump's return, completely forgetting the woman who was giving him a shot at redemption. She thought about her abuela, about the sacrifices she'd made. She thought about all the people who looked at her, at her brown skin, and saw a drain on society.

A lawyer, sharp-suited and smelling of desperation, approached. "Se√±ora, your husband isn't here. We can reschedule, but..." He trailed off, the implication hanging heavy in the air.

Maria straightened her shoulders. She'd come too far to let Billy, or anyone else, determine her fate. "I'll do it myself," she said, her voice trembling but firm. "I'll tell them my story. And if they don't like it, well, maybe this country isn't as great as they claim it is."

She walked into the interview room, alone, ready to fight for her American Dream, even if it meant fighting against the very people who claimed to represent it. The system was rigged, sure, but Maria was a survivor. And she wasn't about to let some deadbeat and some bureaucrats steal her future.
