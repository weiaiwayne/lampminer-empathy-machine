Ugh, my phone's blowing up. Another TikTok trend I need to ignore. Wait, is that a new notification from Reddit? "L1B extension pending... H1B picked... Employer not willing to file H1b..." Sounds like a meme in the making.

Scrolling through the comments, it's the same old grind. Someone's trying to navigate the Kafkaesque nightmare that is US immigration. Asylum, green cards, EADs, waivers... it's all just alphabet soup to me. I mean, good luck to them, but I'm trying to figure out if I should upgrade to the new Galaxy Z Fold 6 or wait for the iPhone 17 Pro Max. Priorities, people!

Birthright citizenship? Eh, sounds like a political dumpster fire I'm not touching with a ten-foot pole. Let the politicians squabble. I'm more concerned with whether my delivery driver is going to find my apartment. I swear, GPS is getting worse every year.

Wait, here's a juicy one: "Got married and being blacked mailed." Dude got played like a cheap fiddle. Classic rom-com plot, but with way more paperwork. Bet there's a subreddit for that.

Then there's this poor sap stuck in Mexico because of some lung lesions. Talk about a buzzkill. Hope he's got good Wi-Fi down there. At least he can still doomscroll like the rest of us.

These people are stressed, man. All this legal stuff, the anxiety of interviews, the fear of deportation... I just want to watch cat videos and argue about Star Wars theories. Maybe I *will* just stick to my tech blogs and meme pages. This immigration stuff is too real. It's like the world's worst MMORPG, but with actual consequences.

Time to fire up YouTube. Gotta catch up on Linus Tech Tips. At least hardware is predictable. Mostly.
