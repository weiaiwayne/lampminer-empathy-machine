The flickering screen cast a pale light on my worn study Bible. Reddit, a modern-day Tower of Babel, buzzed with the anxieties of sojourners in a strange land. Maria, the Mexican mother in Nevada, torn between her husband's undocumented status and the yearning for stability. The Afghan husband, his CR1 visa in hand, facing the daunting journey alone, shadowed by whispers of scrutiny in the news. Each post, a testament to the longing for a place to call home, a theme echoing through scripture from Abraham's wanderings to the exile of Israel.

My heart ached for them. The reformed theology I cling to emphasizes God's sovereignty, yet I wrestle with the complexities of human suffering and the brokenness of systems. I pondered birthright citizenship, the debate raging in the digital halls. Was it a safeguard against injustice, a modern iteration of the promise to Abraham, or a potential burden on a nation already groaning under its own weight? Stephen Miller's failed endeavors further complicated the issue.

My mind drifted to the young Filipino student, meticulously planning his Italian visa application, his future hanging in the balance. The F1 student, stranded by a towed RV, a symbol of the crushing weight of bureaucracy on vulnerable shoulders. I prayed for God's guidance, for wisdom to discern the right path through the labyrinth of immigration laws.

The world felt increasingly hostile. The Mexican man in search of a safe haven, haunted by the specter of the "antichrist" amidst growing anti-immigrant sentiment. I, too, felt the sting of division, the chasm widening between those who embraced the stranger and those who feared them.

Yet, in the midst of this digital turmoil, flickered embers of hope. The community offering advice, sharing stories, providing a lifeline to the lost. The church, a beacon of love and support, offering guidance to a boy caught in the web of DACA. In these acts of compassion, I saw glimmers of God's grace, a reminder that even in the darkest corners of the world, His light still shines, calling us to love our neighbors as ourselves.
