Okay, lemme spin you a yarn based on all that Reddit scrolling I've been doing.

The feed was a firehose of anxieties today. So many people caught in the gears of the system, visas expiring, green cards delayed, haunted by the fear of a knock on the door. It's like everyone's playing a game of immigration roulette, spinning the chamber with their life savings and future.

My phone buzzed with another news alert, something about Trump and Bukele. I swiped it away. Honestly, the political stuff just blurs together after a while. It's like a never-ending meme war with real-life consequences.

I saw this one post, though, that stuck with me. A kid, maybe 15, scared shitless for his dad. His dad works his ass off as a mechanic, but he's undocumented. And now, with all this crackdown stuff, the kid's terrified his dad will get scooped up and sent to some prison camp. It really hits you when you see the fear in that kid's words.

Then there was the woman, wife of a man Wrongfully deported.
Government posted her address online. she's now in a safe house. WTF

I looked over at my own desk, at the new VR headset I'd been drooling over. It was on sale, and I knew I shouldn't but I ordered it anyway. It's easier to dive into a virtual world than to really confront the mess outside.

Maybe that's the problem. We're all too busy chasing the next dopamine hit, the next gadget, the next meme, to actually give a damn about what's happening to other people. We're so plugged in, we're completely disconnected.

I sighed, scrolling through cat videos. Maybe tomorrow I'll try to actually do something, like donate to some legal aid fund or something. But for now? Kitty cuddles and a new virtual reality game sound a lot more appealing. The world's a dumpster fire, but at least I can put on a headset and pretend it's not.
