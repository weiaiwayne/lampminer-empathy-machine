The humid Texas air hung heavy, even at dusk. Maria wiped sweat from her brow, the scent of honeysuckle cloying in the air. Inside the tiny apartment, her son, Mateo, practiced his spelling. "American exceptionalism," he enunciated, his brow furrowed in concentration.

Maria, a legal immigrant from Canada, felt a familiar pang. She remembered her initial excitement about the move, the promise of opportunity. Now, she saw the fear etched on her neighbors' faces, heard the whispers about ICE raids. The news was relentless: detained fathers, deported mothers.

Her phone buzzed. It was Javier, a friend from church. "They took Miguel," the text read. "He was just walking home."

Maria's heart clenched. Miguel, a kind man who always helped with the church's food drives. Undocumented, yes, but hardly a criminal.

She looked at Mateo, his face illuminated by the glow of his tablet. He was a citizen, born on American soil. But what did that even mean anymore? The Fourteenth Amendment, once a beacon of hope, seemed to flicker in the face of rising nativism.

That night, Maria couldn't sleep. She tossed and turned, the weight of uncertainty pressing down on her. She thought of Javier, frantically searching for Miguel. She thought of the asylum seekers she'd met, their stories of persecution and hope, now hanging precariously in the balance.

She knew she had to do something. She couldn't stand by and watch as fear consumed her community. She wasn't sure what that something was yet, but she knew it had to be bold. It had to be a defiant act of love, a testament to the enduring strength of the human spirit, even in the face of MAGA. She thought of the Constitution, the promise of liberty and equal justice for all, and knew she had to fight to keep that promise alive. For Mateo, for Miguel, for everyone who called this country home.
