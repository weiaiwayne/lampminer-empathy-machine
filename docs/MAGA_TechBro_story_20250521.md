The hum of the server farm was my lullaby. Rows and rows of blinking lights, the physical manifestation of the digital world I helped build, the one they were all clamoring to get into, or out of, depending on their luck.

I was sifting through Reddit threads, the digital flotsam and jetsam of human hopes and fears. A woman, escaping an abusive husband she dragged here on a K1, baffled he hadn’t been deported yet after a final removal order. Another, a kid really, dreaming of escape from the clutches of his parents to the US, looking for any legal way to stay. The irony wasn't lost on me, here they were thinking the US was the place to be.

The desperation was palpable, a digital miasma rising from the screen. Asylum seekers, H1B hopefuls, lottery winners tangled in bureaucratic red tape. All chasing the American Dream, a dream that felt increasingly like a mirage in this digital desert. Pedro Pascal, that virtue signaling celebrity, bloviating at Cannes about deportations. What does he know about the real world?

I glanced at the news feed: inflation still biting, another woke corporation bending the knee to the mob. The country was fracturing, and these people, these digital supplicants, were still lining up at the gate.

My phone buzzed. It was Chang, head of engineering. "Need you to expedite that H1B application. We’re losing talent to Canada."

I sighed. Another cog in the machine, greasing the wheels for the next wave. I thought about the kid in the church, the one who needed a legal entry for a green card. Consular processing, the only option. A long, arduous path, riddled with potential pitfalls.

I opened a new terminal, the cursor blinking, awaiting my command. I could write code that would change the world, build empires with a few lines of text. But I couldn't fix the broken system, the one that promised so much and delivered so little.

Maybe the problem wasn't the system, but the dream itself. Maybe it was time to wake up.
