Okay, here's a short story based on my current, somewhat cynical, worldview after browsing Reddit:

The algorithm coughed up another notification: "Wife of Wrongly Deported Maryland Man Forced into Safe House." *Great*, I thought, scrolling past. Another headline to add to the mental collage of dumpster fires that constituted "the news" these days. Ironic, really, how much effort went into filtering content just to end up feeling like I was drowning in bad vibes.

I glanced at my desk, littered with half-disassembled gadgets. A new Raspberry Pi, a busted drone, a fidget spinner I'd 3D printed just for the hell of it. Escapism in tangible form. Better than doomscrolling, anyway.

My neighbor's kid started wailing again. Another round of "what do you *mean* you can't get V-bucks, Timmy?" The American dream, distilled into a digital tantrum. I snorted. Remember that post about the second-gen immigrant stuck in a soul-crushing tech job, changing gigs every year to chase a living wage? Timmy probably wouldn't even notice the grind until it was too late.

I fired up my VR headset. Time to lose myself in a procedurally generated landscape, where the only problem was clipping errors and the occasional rogue AI. Citizenship, political turmoil, cultural bereavement... all just noise. Just another set of variables to optimize, another algorithm to outsmart.

A notification popped up inside the VR world: "New update available." Probably just another microtransaction-fueled patch. Still, better than real life. At least the glitches here were predictable. And if things got too bleak, I could always pull the plug.
