The dust swirled around my server farm, a digital tumbleweed in the air-conditioned chill. My fingers, calloused from years of keyboard wrestling, danced across the terminal, deploying another algorithm designed to optimizeâ€¦ something. Probably ad revenue. Or maybe predicting the next meme to go viral. Doesn't really matter. The machine must be fed.

I saw a post today - some Venezuelan dude tackled in a courthouse. Zero empathy, the headline screamed. And another one about a wife of a deported guy forced into a safe house because the government doxxed her. It's the system, man. It chews you up and spits you out, no matter where you're from. I'm building the cogs, but the machine...it's going haywire.

Remember Caracalla? Expanded citizenship to everyone. Now we're building walls, digital and physical. We say we want the best and brightest, but then we make it a Kafkaesque nightmare for anyone trying to navigate the system. It's not right. The American dream is turning into a pay-to-win game, and the house always wins.

Then, there's the second-gen kid, stuck between worlds, feeling the grind. HCOL, toxic workplaces, the constant pressure. He's got the skills, the ambition, but the game's rigged. It's not the meritocracy they sold us. It's about who you know, what your name sounds like, and how willing you are to sell your soul for a slice of the pie.

I see it all, reflected in the code, in the data streams. A churning sea of ambition and despair, hope and betrayal. I'm building the tools, but I'm not sure they're building a better world. Maybe I should just unplug, buy a ranch in Montana, and raise horses. But then who would keep the machine running? And who would fight for the American dream, the real one, not the one the elites are selling?

I take a swig of my Soylent, the taste metallic and sterile. Time to get back to work. The algorithm won't optimize itself.
