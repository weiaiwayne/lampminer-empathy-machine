The old woman, Mrs. Rodriguez, clutched her rosary, the beads worn smooth by years of anxious prayers. The TV flickered with images of a man being wrestled to the ground in a courthouse – another migrant, another headline fueling the simmering fear in her heart. Her Kilmar, wrongly deported, his name now a bitter taste on her tongue. Jennifer, his wife, forced into hiding, haunted by shadows born of government carelessness.

Lord, have mercy, she whispered, the words familiar, yet feeling hollow.

She thought of Caracalla, that Roman emperor who flung citizenship like coins to appease his subjects. A grand gesture, perhaps, but what did it truly mean? Did it erase the ingrained prejudices, the subtle stings of being seen as ‘other’? Her grandson, born here, speaks perfect English, yet the sneers still come, the assumptions still linger. He carries the weight of his parents’ sacrifices, the pressure to achieve the “American Dream,” a dream that feels increasingly elusive, a treadmill of endless grinding in a world of toxic work environments.

Her granddaughter, a bright young woman, struggled with her identity. Born in America, yet feeling adrift between two cultures, grieving for a homeland she barely knew. The grief wasn’t death, but a loss of belonging, a disconnect that no amount of polite conversation could bridge. Mrs. Rodriguez remembered her own arrival, the initial hope curdling into a slow burn of loneliness.

The news then flashed to Trump, his face a granite mask of determination. The weight of the world pressed down on her shoulders, a world where fear trumped compassion, where borders hardened, and where the promise of refuge felt increasingly like a cruel illusion. She clung tighter to her rosary. It was all she had left, a fragile thread connecting her to a God who seemed increasingly distant in this fractured, anxious world. Yet she prayed for justice, for mercy, for a glimmer of hope in the encroaching darkness, for her children, and her grandchildren, and for all the lost souls caught in the crosscurrents of this turbulent age. She prayed they would find a home, a place of belonging, a life of peace, and that the Lord would guide them through these difficult times.
