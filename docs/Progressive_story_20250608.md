The fluorescent hum of the DMV buzzed in my ears, a soundtrack to the quiet desperation clinging to the air. Maria, usually a whirlwind of nervous energy, sat beside me, a small, crumpled I-94 form clutched in her hand. Lost green card, lost license, lost identity in a system that demanded proof she no longer possessed.

I’d seen it before, this bureaucratic quicksand. A friend of a friend, a DACA recipient, stuck in limbo after a USCIS "glitch" – a system error that somehow erased his biometrics. Now, Maria, a refugee who had fled unspeakable horrors, was facing a similar digital oblivion. The irony stung. A system built on supposed order, on meticulous record-keeping, was instead capable of rendering people invisible.

Across the room, a young couple nervously practiced interview questions in hushed tones. "How did you meet? What are your future plans?" Performative love for the gatekeepers. I remembered the fear in my own voice during my naturalization interview, the pressure to prove my worthiness.

Outside, the summer heat shimmered off the asphalt. A beat-up pickup truck roared past, emblazoned with a defiant "Trump 2024" sticker. A chill ran down my spine. The stories of targeted deportations, of families ripped apart, felt less like distant headlines and more like a looming threat.

Maria sighed, her eyes fixed on the DMV clerk's blank expression. "Two years," she whispered, referring to the estimated wait time for her replacement card. Two years without a license, without a secure sense of belonging. Two years of living in the shadows, perpetually vulnerable.

I squeezed her hand. "We'll figure it out," I said, my voice laced with a resolve I didn't entirely feel. We would scour legal aid resources, contact advocacy groups, fight for her right to exist, to drive, to live without fear. Because in a world where systems fail, where humanity seems to dwindle with each passing day, all we have is each other. And sometimes, that's enough to keep the light alive.
