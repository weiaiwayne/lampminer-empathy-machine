The chipped mug warmed my hands as I scrolled, the Reddit feed a kaleidoscope of anxieties and hopes, a modern-day Ellis Island compressed onto a screen. Caracalla’s ghost winked at me from an article about immigration policy, a reminder that empires rise and fall, and the question of who belongs remains stubbornly, tragically, the same.

A second-gen South Asian American lamented the grind, the discrimination, the hollow promise of the "American Dream." I felt a pang of recognition. This system chews people up, spits them out, regardless of where they were born. It’s a machine built for profit, not for people.

Then came the ache of "migratory grief," a pain I understand on an intuitive level. The loss of belonging, the constant search for a common language, the feeling of being adrift, even when surrounded. It's a non-death, a severance from a past that continues to exist, just out of reach.

The desperate queries for help cut through the noise: a green card delayed, a Venezuelan man tackled in a courthouse, a mother fearing deportation, a child forced to consider military service to save their parents. The legal labyrinth, a system designed to dehumanize, to break spirits.

And then, the story of the horse. Deported. It was absurd, heartbreaking. If they can do that to a horse, what hope do humans have?

The weight of it all settled in my chest. This digital scroll was not just information, it was a collective scream. A scream against injustice, against the relentless machinery of oppression, against the casual cruelty of a system that values profit over people.

I took a long sip of my tea, the warmth a small act of defiance. It wasn’t enough, but it was something. I closed my laptop, the screen reflecting my own weary face. The fight for justice, for equity, for basic human dignity, it never ends. And we, the digital inheritors of Caracalla's dream, must keep screaming until we are heard. We must build a world where belonging isn’t a privilege, but a right. And we must start, always, with empathy.
