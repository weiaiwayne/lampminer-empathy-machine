The old hymnal fell open to "A Mighty Fortress Is Our God," a familiar comfort in a world tilting on its axis. My fingers, stained with coffee from a morning spent wrestling with Romans, traced the words. I’d been praying for guidance, for discernment amidst the anxieties swirling online, a digital Babylon of hopes dashed on the rocks of bureaucracy and fear.

Sister Agnes, a beacon of quiet faith in our small church, had told me, "The Lord works in mysterious ways, brother. Sometimes, He uses even the internet to show us where the need is." And the need, I saw, was immense.

Young couples, their dreams tangled in visa applications and I-864 forms, their love a fragile flame against the winds of immigration law. Desperate souls, clinging to U4U status, yearning for the green card that would allow them to rebuild shattered lives, to reunite with families torn apart by war.

I thought of Pedro Pascal, a voice of conscience on a glamorous stage, speaking truth to power about deportations. I considered the Afghan husband, alone and vulnerable, navigating a new world without the comfort of a familiar tongue. And the young DACA recipient, facing an I-485 interview, haunted by the specter of a system that could snatch away the only home he'd ever known.

I’d seen the anxieties etched in the digital faces of strangers, the fear in their pleas for advice, the quiet desperation in their rants. The system, designed to offer refuge and opportunity, often seemed to be a labyrinth of red tape and arbitrary decisions.

But then I remembered the words of Paul: "Be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, faithful in prayer." I realized my calling wasn't to solve the immigration crisis, but to offer a listening ear, a word of encouragement, a reminder that even in the darkest valleys, the light of Christ still shines.

I closed the hymnal, a renewed sense of purpose settling in my heart. I might not have the answers, but I could offer compassion, a tangible expression of God's love in a world desperately seeking it. And maybe, just maybe, that was enough.
