The news feed is a dumpster fire, tbh. One minute it's Caracalla giving everyone citizenship back in the day, the next it's some poor kid from El Salvador terrified his dad's gonna get disappeared into a Bukele prison camp for having a cross tattoo. Like, ancient history lessons to modern day nightmares in one scroll.

I'm just trying to keep up with the latest phone release and avoid doomscrolling myself into a depression. But even tech is tainted. Heard about some DHS system screwing over F1 visa holders based on arrest records, not convictions? Algorithm gone wild, ruining lives. Sounds like a Black Mirror episode waiting to happen.

And the stories... Damn, the stories. That woman whose address got blasted online after her husband was wrongly deported? WTAF? Like, the government doxxing people now? I saw a report on the news about the ICE deports 4 y.o. US citizen with CANCER. What the hell?

Then there's the personal stuff. Someone's worried about their green card expiring, another's got a weird age gap marriage and is terrified of being deported. It's all just... layers of anxiety and uncertainty.

I saw someone posted a link to a story about a horse getting deported. A horse! At this point, nothing surprises me.

You know what? I need a meme break. Something with a Shiba Inu, maybe. Or that distracted boyfriend one. Anything to short-circuit this constant stream of digital dread. Because if I don't, I'm gonna end up ranting on Twitter about the decline of civilization, and nobody wants to see that. Except maybe the bots, who are probably already tracking my every move anyway.

Okay, deep breaths. Meme time. Maybe I'll order that new noise-canceling headset too. Gotta drown out the noise somehow.
