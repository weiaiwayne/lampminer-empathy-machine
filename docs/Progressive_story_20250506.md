The hum of the laundromat was a constant, a low thrum against the anxiety clawing at my throat. Every spin cycle felt like another news article flashing across my mental screen: *ICE deports child cancer patient. Wife of wrongly deported man forced into hiding. Trump’s travel ban looms.*

Maria, her face etched with worry lines deeper than her age should allow, folded her children’s clothes with the practiced motions of a woman who’d done this a thousand times. We'd met here, sharing worried glances over overflowing laundry baskets. She was from El Salvador, a green card holder, but the whispers were getting louder, the fear palpable.

"My son," she said, her voice barely audible above the clatter, "He wants to join the military. He thinks it will protect us."

Protect. A child thinking he could protect his parents from the arbitrary sweep of a government. My stomach twisted. I wanted to tell her it was a noble idea, a desperate act of love. But the news…the news painted a different picture. Even service wasn't a guarantee anymore.

I remembered the Reddit thread about the wrongly deported man, Abrego Garcia. His wife’s address, splashed across social media, a target painted on their home. The casual cruelty of it, the disregard for human life. It was like the digital equivalent of a burning cross on a lawn.

Maria sighed, pulling a tiny Spiderman t-shirt from the dryer. "I just want them to be safe," she whispered, her eyes glistening. "Is that too much to ask?"

Too much to ask in a nation built on the promise of refuge, on the ideal of opportunity? It felt obscene, this constant state of precarity, this gnawing fear that the rug could be pulled out from under you at any moment.

I handed her a dryer sheet, our fingers brushing. A silent acknowledgment of shared fear, shared vulnerability. The spin cycle ended with a clang. Another load of laundry, another day closer to an uncertain future. But in that moment, in the shared, quiet space of the laundromat, we were not alone. We were a community, bound together by the fragile threads of hope, resilience, and the unwavering belief that things *had* to get better.
