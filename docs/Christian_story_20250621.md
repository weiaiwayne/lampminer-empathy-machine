The fluorescent lights of the courtroom hummed, a discordant choir to the anxieties swirling within me. I watched a young woman, no older than my daughter, clutch a worn folder to her chest. Her asylum case, her last chance. I prayed silently, remembering Matthew 25:35, "For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me." This scripture echoes in my heart. As a Christian, I am called to care for the vulnerable, the stranger, the one seeking refuge. Yet, the complexities of earthly laws often clash with the simplicity of Christ's commandment.

I've seen the Reddit threads, the raw, desperate pleas for help navigating the labyrinthine immigration system. H1B visas, F1 students, green cards, asylum applications - a sea of acronyms representing human hopes and fears. I see the young man, the Ukrainian, yearning to build a life, start a business. Is his passion strong enough to overcome the bureaucratic hurdles? Will his faith sustain him?

Then there's the fear. I read of ICE raids, of families torn apart, of good people living in constant dread. How can we, as a nation founded on ideals of liberty and justice for all, allow such fear to fester? I read of the deported, the ones sent back, and the questions that arise in my heart. How much is the cost? How much is the expense? How much is the cost of deporting a person compared to what they would be able to contribute?

The judge called the woman's name. I bowed my head, whispering a prayer for mercy and understanding. I thought of the words of the Apostle Paul: "Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God."(Romans 13:1) But is it right to follow the laws of man that are not in line with the laws of God? I do not know.

The world is full of these questions. The answers are not always clear. But my faith compels me to act with compassion, to advocate for justice, and to remember that every face in that courtroom, every name on those Reddit threads, is a child of God, deserving of dignity and grace.
