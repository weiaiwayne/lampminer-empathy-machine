Okay, lemme spitball here based on all that Reddit scrolling.

The notification pinged. Another USCIS app, promising to "simplify your immigration journey!" Right. Like anyone *really* knew what was going on with that black box of forms and fees. You paid, you waited, you refreshed the page every five minutes. Some people got lucky, some got deported; some just got stuck in limbo.

The story that was trending about the mechanic from Canada who wanted to move to New York, legally, but didn't know where to start. He probably just needs to marry an American.

Then there's the guy who brought his wife to the U.S. and his father in law wanted to work, like that was just going to happen.

The feed was full of these stories. People desperate, people hopeful, people getting screwed. The lawyer ads popped up too, promising the world, but you knew they were just as clueless as everyone else.

Pedro Pascal talking about deportation at Cannes. Like that helps. What does Pedro Pascal know about how the system works? He’s just an actor, reading lines someone else wrote. Another celebrity virtue signaling.

I scrolled past the latest meme – something about a dog wearing a tiny MAGA hat. I didn't engage. Politics were noise. Just background radiation in the constant stream of information. I was more interested in the new phone coming out next month.

My head felt like a browser with too many tabs open, each one a story of hope and fear, legal loopholes and bureaucratic nightmares. The world felt like a giant, glitching simulation, where the rules were constantly changing and no one really knew what was going on. Maybe I should just start a TikTok account about how pointless it all is.
