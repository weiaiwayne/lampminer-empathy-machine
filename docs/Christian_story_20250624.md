The fluorescent lights of the church basement hummed, a sterile counterpoint to the hopeful chatter swirling around me. We were gathered for a potluck, a mismatched collection of Tupperware and souls all seeking something: community, belonging, a sliver of the American dream. I watched Maria, her face etched with a quiet desperation, carefully arrange empanadas on a paper plate. Her husband, I knew, was facing deportation, a phantom hanging over their small apartment like a storm cloud.

Reddit had been my teacher lately, a chaotic marketplace of anxieties and whispered hopes. I saw Maria’s struggle mirrored in countless posts: the fear of ICE raids, the labyrinthine forms, the crushing weight of uncertainty. I prayed for her, a silent plea for grace and mercy, for a softening of hearts in the sterile halls of power.

Later, young David, a bright-eyed DREAMer, approached me, his face alight with a new possibility. He’d been accepted into a STEM program, a full scholarship. But the shadow of the 214(b) loomed, the immigrant intent clause, a constant threat to his future. I encouraged him, reminding him of the unwavering faith of Daniel, who trusted God even in the face of a fiery furnace. His diligence and reliance on God would be his strength.

The world felt increasingly precarious. Birthright citizenship, a cornerstone of our nation, was under attack, fueled by anxieties about financial ruin. Even amongst my brothers and sisters in Christ, I could hear the whispers of fear, the desire to pull up the ladder, to protect what they had.

But Jesus called us to something different. He called us to love the stranger, to welcome the sojourner, to see the image of God in every human being, regardless of their papers or their past. I thought of the Afghan veteran, desperately seeking safety for his family, haunted by the shadows of conflict. And I wondered about the moral implications of it all.

As the evening drew to a close, I found myself drawn back to Maria. "Remember," I whispered, placing a hand on her shoulder, "God is sovereign, and His grace is sufficient."

The words felt inadequate, a small offering in the face of such immense need. But it was all I had, a testament to the unwavering hope that, even in the darkest of times, God's light would ultimately prevail, one prayer, one act of kindness, one empanada at a time.
