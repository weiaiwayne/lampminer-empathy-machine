Okay, let's do this.

The screen flickered, another Reddit thread dissolving into the digital ether. This one was about some poor sap whose green card interview got canned. "Scheduled and Cancelled (for EB1 based)" the title blared. Felt bad, man. All that waiting, all that hoping, just *poof*.

It all felt like a giant, glitching video game. Everyone scrambling for power-ups – visas, green cards, citizenship – while the rules kept changing mid-game. One minute you're collecting coins, the next the floor disappears.

I swiped over to a meme, a Shiba Inu looking mournful next to the words "H1B Denial Feels." At least the internet still understood.

It was the churn that got to me, the constant, low-level anxiety humming beneath the surface of daily life. The thread about the wife of the deported guy hiding in a safe house, the one about the Salvadoran kid scared for his dad… it was like a horror movie, except it was real, and the monsters were bureaucracy and fear.

Even the bright shiny objects, the tech and gadgets, felt tainted. What's the point of a new VR headset when people are getting ripped from their lives? It was like trying to play *Fortnite* while Rome burned.

My phone buzzed. It was a notification from a news app: "Trump Promises Stricter Immigration Laws if Elected." *Sigh*. More floor disappearing. Another power-up nerfed.

Maybe ignorance *was* bliss. Maybe I should just stick to cat videos and drone reviews. But then I remembered the thread about the guy building an app to help immigrants navigate the system. A tiny flicker of hope in the digital darkness.

It’s a mess, this world. A beautiful, terrifying, meme-filled mess. And I'm just sitting here, scrolling, trying to make sense of it all, one Reddit post at a time, hoping for a glitch that'll finally work in someone's favor.
