Okay, here's my take on the world, based on what I've been reading:

The glow of the screen illuminated my face, another meme scrolled past – some doge variation about PERM approvals. Honestly, I barely registered it. My feed was a constant stream of anxieties I couldn't relate to, anxieties about "home residency requirements" and "birthright citizenship" and "removal orders." Like, chill. Get a hobby.

Someone was asking about a speeding ticket and its impact on their H1B. I stifled a yawn. I mean, follow the rules dude, or don't, whatever. It's a ticket.

I clicked on a link about Pedro Pascal talking about immigration at Cannes. Cool, I guess. Celebrities and their causes. I'm more interested in when the new RTX 5000 series is dropping.

I swiped through some more Reddit threads. A post about someone’s dad stuck in Mexico waiting for lung test results. That sucks, for sure. But what am I supposed to do? Send a fruit basket? Hit up the 'ol socials to virtue signal?

Another thread, this one about someone getting blackmailed after getting married. Seriously? What is this, a soap opera? I scroll back to the meme page. At least that's authentic. It doesn't pretend to be anything other than absurd.

I closed my laptop. The world outside was probably just as messy, just as full of people stressing about things I didn't understand. Maybe I'd grab some takeout. I saw on TikTok that that new ramen place downtown was supposed to be fire. Priorities, people.
