Okay, here's a story based on what I've been absorbing from Reddit lately. It's a bit bleak, but hey, that's the mood, right?

The screen glowed, another late-night doomscroll session fading into the early hours. Maria clutched her phone, the blue light reflecting in her tired eyes. Her fingers, stained with turmeric from the restaurant, danced across the keyboard, refreshing the USCIS website. Still "Case Received" for her husband's I-485. Six months. An eternity.

She flicked over to a thread about ICE raids. The comments were a mix of fear, anger, and a detached kind of resignation. One thread, talking about the new Trump admin, was particularly disturbing. It was about a family's green card interview, the husband uncooperative out of spite. Maria shivered. She knew that kind of spite.

Her husband, Carlos, stirred beside her. He was a good man, a hard worker. He deserved this. They both did. They’d followed the rules, paid the fees, navigated the labyrinth of forms. But the anxiety was a constant companion, a low hum beneath the surface of their lives. What if the interview went wrong? What if some forgotten detail from years ago surfaced? What if...

She closed the app, trying to shut out the noise. Memes were next. A quick hit of dopamine to counteract the dread. A dog wearing sunglasses. A cat judging her life choices. Something, anything, to distract her from the gnawing fear that she wasn't sure if her green card would be approved.

Carlos mumbled in his sleep, a word she couldn’t quite catch. Maria reached out and brushed a stray strand of hair from his forehead. He was her anchor, her reason. She wouldn't let the algorithms and the anxieties win. Tomorrow, she'd focus on the small things: the perfect pupusa, the laughter of her children, the quiet strength of their love. Because in this world of endless scrolling and uncertain futures, sometimes, the only thing you could control was holding on tight to what you had.
