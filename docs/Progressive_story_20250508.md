The flickering neon sign of the internet cafe cast a sickly green glow on my face, reflecting in the countless browser tabs I had open. Each one a window into someone else's struggle, a pixelated cry for help lost in the digital ether.

A green card holder in Pakistan, paralyzed by the fear of increasing restrictions, wondering if they should abandon their electrical engineering dreams for the uncertain safety of America. A Salvadorian teen, haunted by the specter of Trump and Bukele, terrified his father, a hardworking mechanic with a simple cross tattoo, would be swallowed by the maw of Cecot. A mother, her own citizenship secured after decades, now consumed by the irrational fear of deportation, her sanity dissolving in the toxic brew of social media anxieties.

The world felt like a pressure cooker, the lid threatening to blow at any moment. The threads of injustice were spun so finely, so intricately, it was nearly impossible to untangle them. Caracalla's Edict, once a beacon of Roman inclusivity, now echoed hollowly against the walls of modern xenophobia. The promise of America, once a shimmering mirage of opportunity, lay tarnished and broken for so many.

Even the lucky ones, the second-generation immigrants, the "successful" ones, were wrestling with the toxic work culture, the relentless grind, the subtle (and not-so-subtle) discrimination that chipped away at their souls.

But amidst the digital despair, flickers of hope emerged, like stubborn wildflowers pushing through concrete. A community rallying around a wrongly deported man, forcing the government to reckon with its cruelty. Individuals crafting tools to navigate the labyrinthine immigration system, to offer solace and guidance to those lost in the bureaucratic maze.

The weight of the world settled on my shoulders, but I refused to succumb. I closed the tabs, one by one, each click a small act of defiance. The fight for justice was a marathon, not a sprint. And even in the face of overwhelming darkness, the embers of hope could still ignite a revolution. It was time to log off, step outside, and find my place in that fight.
