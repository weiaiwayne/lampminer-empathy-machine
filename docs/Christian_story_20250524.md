The flickering screen cast a pale light on my study, highlighting the worn pages of my Reformation Study Bible. Outside, the cicadas thrummed their incessant song, a summer lament that mirrored the anxieties swirling within me. Iâ€™d been lost again in the digital labyrinth of Reddit, a place where the hopes and fears of strangers, often desperate and displaced, echoed in the digital ether.

The stories clung to me like burrs: the Afghan man, alone and uncertain, navigating a new country; the DACA recipient, finally facing a green card interview, haunted by the shadows of the past; the mother in Mexico, lungs under suspicion, her future hanging in the balance. Each thread a testament to the brokenness of the world, a world crying out for redemption.

My heart ached for them. As a Christian, I believe we are called to love our neighbors, especially the vulnerable. Yet, the sheer scale of human suffering, magnified by the internet's relentless flow of information, can feel overwhelming. How do we reconcile the promise of grace with the harsh realities of immigration law, political maneuvering, and systemic injustice?

I closed my Bible, the weight of it familiar and comforting. The reformed tradition teaches us about God's sovereignty, His meticulous plan for all creation. But it also acknowledges the reality of human sin, the fallen nature that twists good intentions and creates suffering. It wasn't enough to simply offer platitudes of faith. These were real people, wrestling with tangible problems. 

I thought about that mobile home, purchased with borrowed money, now held hostage by betrayal and legal complexities. I thought about the young woman in the UK, unsure if she will find a place she can call home. I thought about the couple co-signing the lease. Were they acting out of love or was it a means to an end? Each situation was unique, a tapestry woven with threads of hope, fear, and the ever-present threat of disappointment.

Perhaps the answer wasn't in grand pronouncements or sweeping solutions, but in the small, everyday acts of compassion. A listening ear, a word of encouragement, a prayer offered in sincerity. To be a light in the darkness, however small, was a calling worth pursuing. And to trust, even when the path ahead was shrouded in uncertainty, that God's grace, like the steady hum of the cicadas, would endure.
