The courtroom air hung thick with a stale, anxious anticipation. I shifted in the hard, varnished pew, feeling a twitch of resentment. Here I was, the only American-born guy in the damn office, playing chauffeur and emotional support animal for folks who hadn’t bothered to do things the right way. I glanced at the woman beside me, her face pale and drawn. Elena. She was a hard worker, I'll give her that, but hard work doesn’t trump the rule of law.

The judge, a woman with a face like granite, droned through legalese. Elena’s lawyer, a slick character in a poorly-fitted suit, mumbled replies. I tried to focus, but my mind kept drifting back to the Reddit threads. "Illegal entry at 3 months old… pending DACA since 2020… legal entry is their only option." The kid was practically raised here, but the law is the law.

Then I remembered the article about Europe. "Birthright citizenship is virtually nonexistent… slow and uncertain process…" Maybe we're being too generous. Maybe the Fourteenth Amendment needs a second look. After all, what’s the point of citizenship if it’s not valued, if it’s not earned?

The judge banged her gavel. "Asylum denied."

Elena gasped, a small, choked sound. The lawyer started arguing, but it was useless. The granite face was unmoved. My stomach clenched. I felt a pang of something… pity? No. It was frustration. Frustration that our system was so easily exploited, that the rules were so often bent and broken.

As we walked out, Elena’s shoulders slumped. "What now?" she whispered.

I didn’t have an answer. All I knew was that this wasn’t right. Not for her, maybe, but definitely not for the country. We needed to build a wall, not just on the border, but around our laws, around our values. Make citizenship something to strive for, not something handed out like candy. Maybe then, the courtroom wouldn’t feel like a constant, slow-motion defeat.
