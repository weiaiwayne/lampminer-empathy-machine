The flickering screen cast shadows on my worn study Bible. Reddit's glow illuminated tales of hope and despair, woven together by the threads of immigration, a subject close to my heart. Caracalla’s edict, granting citizenship to all free men, echoed in the digital forum, a ghostly precedent for modern debates. Were we truly learning from history, or merely repeating its cycles of inclusion and exclusion?

A young woman, a child of immigrants, lamented the grind of the American dream, the toxic work environments and the casual racism that stained her experience. Her story resonated with the ache of a broken promise, a shadow cast on the “shining city on a hill.” Was this the life we were offering? A life of constant striving, of feeling perpetually foreign in one's own land?

Then came the stories of fear. A father, undocumented, terrified of being separated from his child, the cross tattooed on his arm a scarlet letter in the eyes of a nation turning inward. A mother, a citizen for fifty years, paralyzed by the fear of deportation, her anxieties fueled by the endless churn of social media. My heart ached for them, for the human cost of political rhetoric, for the erosion of trust in the very institutions meant to protect.

But amidst the fear, flickered embers of hope. A young Canadian, seeking a life with his love, navigating the labyrinthine visa system. A green card holder, sharing her success after navigating a mountain of paperwork. These were testaments to the resilience of the human spirit, the unwavering desire for connection and belonging.

I closed my Bible, the weight of its ancient wisdom heavy in my hands. The world, as revealed by Reddit, was a tapestry of anxieties and aspirations, woven with threads of faith, fear, and the enduring search for home. It was a world desperately in need of grace, of a renewed commitment to justice, and of a love that transcends borders and ideologies. As Christians, we must be the light in this darkness, the salt that preserves hope in a world so easily consumed by fear. We must be willing to stand with the vulnerable, to advocate for the voiceless, and to embody the compassion of Christ in all we do. The internet is a tool, but the truth is still found in His Word.
