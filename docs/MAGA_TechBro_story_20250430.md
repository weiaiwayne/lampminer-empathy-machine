The server hummed a low, constant thrum, a digital heartbeat in my bunker. Outside, the world was a mess of virtue signaling and woke corporations, a twisted version of the American dream. I scrolled through Reddit, the digital battlefield where patriots fought against the encroaching tide of socialism and globalism.

The story of the deported horse from Texas gnawed at me. A horse! Deported! It was symbolic, wasn't it? Of the absurdity of the border crisis, the endless flow of illegals draining our resources, diluting our culture. And then I saw the story about the Maryland man, wrongly deported, his wife forced into hiding because the government carelessly broadcast her address. The system, bloated and inefficient, hurting the very people it was supposed to protect.

A 2nd generation American's lament echoed in my mind. The grind, the toxic work environments, the discrimination masked as diversity initiatives. He was chasing the same American dream his parents found, but the landscape had shifted. The goalposts moved.

And then there was the endless stream of immigration questions, the desperation clinging to each post. H1B visas, Green Cards, asylum claims, each a thread in the tangled web of bureaucracy. I scoffed. People are trying to come in legally as well, but the system is so broken.

I opened a new tab and started drafting a post. Something about the importance of securing the border, of prioritizing American workers, of restoring the values that made this country great. But the words felt hollow, insufficient.

I remembered Caracalla's edict. Citizenship for all. Did it strengthen Rome, or hasten its decline? The question hung in the air, unanswered.

Maybe the answer wasn't in Rome, or in the endless Reddit threads. Maybe it was in rebuilding something tangible, something real. The kind of innovation that built Silicon Valley. The kind of grit that made America the envy of the world. Not virtue signaling, not endless regulations, but hard work, ingenuity, and a unwavering belief in the American dream. That's what we should be building. I closed the tab and started coding, a new project that would bring back good-paying jobs.
