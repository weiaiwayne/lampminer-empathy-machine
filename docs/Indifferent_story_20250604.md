Okay, lemme try to string some of this Reddit stuff together...

The phone buzzed with another meme, something about a cat judging a salad. I chuckled, scrolling past it to see what the algorithm had deemed important today. Mostly immigration stuff, honestly. Seems like everyone's trying to figure out how to get *in* or *stay* in the US, or get *out* of the US, or get someone *else* in or out of the US. Itâ€™s a whole thing.

There's this dude on U4U, stuck 'cause he can't marry his Ukrainian wife until she gets a green card, but he wants her here *now*. Then there's the Afghan guy, just got his visa, but his wife's freaking 'cause of "everything in the news." Like, chill out, lady. It's probably fine.

Then there's the Canadian dude who's finally gonna be a dad, and is scared shitless of ICE. I feel bad for him.

I get it, though. The world's kinda... intense. I saw a post about birthright citizenship in Europe. They don't even have it. It's crazy, like you could be born there and still not be a citizen. That's wild.

My buddy from work is stressing about his asylum hearing. Dude came here when he was a kid, and now, at 37, he's still in limbo. Makes you think, what's the point of all this? Chasing some "American dream" that might just be a mirage.

I saw Pedro Pascal at Cannes talking about deportations. Celebrities and their opinions, am I right?

Honestly, I just want to get a new graphics card and play some games. Maybe order some takeout. The world's a dumpster fire, but at least the pizza's good. And I got my phone and my memes. That's enough, right?
