The digital wind howled across the Reddit plains, a cacophony of anxieties and aspirations. I scrolled, my heart heavy with the burdens of strangers. A young woman from Trinidad, denied a visa despite her job, her business, her marriage – a testament to the capricious nature of earthly judgment. Lord, have mercy.

Then there was the Afghan husband, soon to arrive alone, his English faltering, navigating a land where suspicion clings to the unfamiliar. I prayed for him, for safe passage and a welcoming embrace, a reflection of Your own boundless hospitality.

The threads of desperation were woven tightly. A DACA recipient, mistakenly signing up for self-deportation, a stark reminder of the precariousness of their existence. The chilling question of ICE raids, the fear in a mother’s voice, desperate to protect her mixed-race child. Even the joy of a green card approval was tinged with anxiety, the lingering wait for the physical card, the bureaucratic hurdles that seemed designed to test the spirit.

I saw the flicker of hope, too. The Canadian legal assistant, yearning for a life in Florida, a testament to the enduring allure of this nation. The mechanic, skilled and diligent, seeking opportunity in New York, a reminder of the promise this land still holds. And then, the most poignant of all, the tale of rekindled love, marred by an impending self-deportation. A heartbreak that echoed the greater sorrows of exile and separation.

The world, as these digital confessions revealed, was a tapestry of longing and fear, of dreams deferred and opportunities denied. It was a place where the law, meant to be a shield, often felt like a sword. Yet, amidst the chaos, I saw glimpses of Your light – the unwavering love of a spouse, the fierce protection of a parent, the enduring hope for a better future.

My task, as I see it, is to pray for these souls, to offer a word of encouragement where I can, and to remember that even in the darkest corners, Your grace can shine through. I must also acknowledge my own privilege, my own secure citizenship, and use it to advocate for justice and compassion, to be a voice for the voiceless, and a hand to the weary. For we are all, in the end, sojourners on this earth, seeking a home that is truly eternal.
