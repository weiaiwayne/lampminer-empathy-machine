Okay, so like, I'm just chilling, scrolling through Reddit, right? And it's always the same kinda vibe. People stressed about visas, green cards, ICE...it's a whole thing.

There's this dude talking about his friend's dad, the one who crossed the border illegally. Dude's got a life now, trucking company, kids, but he's sweating bullets 'cause Trump 2.0 might just kick him out. Makes you think, like, what's the point of building something if it can just be snatched away?

Then there's this girl, all excited 'cause she got her green card approved super fast. Like, congrats, but it's kinda bitter-sweet, you know? 'Cause for every win like that, there's a million people stuck in limbo, waiting for their lives to start.

And then some other guy is asking if ICE can track phones. Like, that's some Black Mirror shit right there. The government always knows where you are. It is kinda frightening.

I see this girl who needs to get her marriage certificate translated. Like, good for her, but it also reminds me that like, a lot of people are just trying to find love and a place to belong, and they have to deal with all this bureaucratic crap just to make it happen.

It's all just...heavy, man. Makes you wanna unplug and watch cat videos or something. But then you feel guilty, 'cause ignoring it doesn't make it go away.

I saw this meme the other day, like, "Being an adult is just googling how to do things you should already know." Immigration is like that too. Everyone's just scrambling, trying to figure it out as they go, hoping they don't screw up and get sent back.

Maybe I should just stick to tech reviews and memes. At least those are predictable. But then again, even the tech world is getting all political now. Guess there's no escaping it. Guess I'll just keep scrolling.
