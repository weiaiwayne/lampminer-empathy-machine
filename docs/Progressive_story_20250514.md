Okay, here's my take on things, based on what I've been reading. It's a creative piece, reflecting the anxieties and realities I'm processing:

The chipped Formica table at the diner reflects the pre-dawn sodium glare. Maria stirs her coffee, the spoon clinking a nervous rhythm against the thick ceramic. Outside, the city is still holding its breath, waiting for the day to decide if it will be kind or cruel.

She’s been here for twenty years, raised a family, paid her taxes, and yet… the anxiety simmers. It’s in the news, in the whispers at the grocery store, in the way her neighbor suddenly avoids eye contact. The stories of families torn apart, of children born here ripped from their homes, echo in her mind.

Her son, a citizen, sleeps upstairs. He dreams of college, of a life she desperately wants him to have. But how can he focus on differential equations when the shadow of deportation hangs over their heads? How can he truly belong when his mother is made to feel like a guest, a burden, a potential threat?

The newsfeed scrolls across her phone, a litany of broken promises and shifting goalposts. The stories of lawyers overcharging, of families being scammed, of the sheer bureaucratic nightmare that is immigration, swirl around her. It’s a system designed to break you, to bleed you dry, to make you feel utterly powerless.

She thinks of her own mother, forced to leave her homeland, a land she still grieves for, even as she built a new life here. The grief of displacement is a constant companion, a silent ache.

The bell above the door jingles. A man in a worn uniform enters, his face etched with exhaustion. He orders coffee, his eyes flickering around the room. Maria tenses, her heart pounding. Is he here for her? Is this the moment?

But then he smiles, a weary, genuine smile, at the waitress. He’s just a man, trying to make it through another day.

Maria takes a deep breath. She will not be paralyzed by fear. She will fight for her family, for her right to belong. She will find resources, connect with others, and demand justice. The fight is exhausting, but the alternative is unthinkable. She will not let the system break her. Not today. Not ever.
