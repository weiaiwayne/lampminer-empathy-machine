Okay, here's my attempt at a short story based on what I've absorbed from the Reddit threads, reflecting my indifferent, tech-focused, meme-adjacent worldview:

Rain lashed against the window of the "WeWork: Global Migration Edition" – or, as everyone called it, the "Visa Vortex." Kai scrolled through TikTok, another video of Pedro Pascal advocating for immigrants, overlaid with a sped-up, bass-boosted remix of "Running Up That Hill." He chuckled dryly. Performative wokeness was the new fidget spinner.

His phone pinged. A notification from the USCIS app – still the clunky, government-issued beta version. "Case Status: Actively Reviewing." He'd been waiting for what felt like geological epochs for his green card. Marriage to a US citizen was supposed to be the express lane, but even that felt like navigating a poorly designed escape room.

He glanced at the guy across the co-working table, furiously typing on his laptop. Probably trying to figure out if a coding bootcamp counted as "advanced degree" for some visa category. The air thrummed with the quiet desperation of people chasing the American Dream, or at least, a slightly less dystopian version of their current reality.

Kai returned to his screen. A meme: Drake looking disapprovingly at a picture of birthright citizenship, then nodding approvingly at a picture of skilled worker visas. He saved it, thinking of his parents back in Ontario. Maybe he *should* look into that job in Indiana. Stability was a meme in itself these days, a nostalgic throwback to a simpler time before crypto crashes and looming SCOTUS decisions.

Another ping. This one from Bumble. "New Match!" He swiped right, hoping for someone who understood the existential dread of being a cog in the globalized machine, preferably someone who could also explain the difference between an L1B and an EB-1C. The pursuit of happiness, after all, was just another algorithm.
