The fluorescent lights of the community center hummed, a soundtrack to the anxieties swirling in my gut. Maria, a woman whose hands were permanently stained with the red earth of her Guatemalan village, sat across from me, her eyes wide and pleading. Tomorrow was her asylum hearing.

"¿Qué va a pasar si me dicen que no?" *What will happen if they say no?*

I squeezed her hand, the only US-born citizen in our makeshift support group. I'd seen the fear before, the raw terror of a system designed to grind people down. I thought of the Reddit threads, the desperate pleas for help navigating the labyrinth of USCIS, the stories of families torn apart.

"We fight," I told her, my voice shaking slightly. "We appeal. We find other options." Empty words, maybe, but what else could I offer? I thought of Pedro Pascal at Cannes, using his platform to speak out against deportations. We needed more voices like that, more people to see the humanity behind the paperwork.

Later, scrolling through my phone, I saw a post about a DACA recipient, terrified about ICE raids, about the possibility of his child being snatched away. The image of Maria's son, Mateo, flashed in my mind. A bright, curious boy who deserved to grow up without the specter of deportation hanging over him.

I felt a familiar anger ignite within me. This wasn't just about paperwork and legal loopholes; it was about lives, about families, about the fundamental right to exist. The system was broken, built on fear and exclusion, and it was our duty to dismantle it, brick by agonizing brick.

I closed my eyes, picturing a future where birthright citizenship wasn't debated, where asylum seekers were met with compassion instead of suspicion, where everyone had the chance to thrive, regardless of where they were born. It was a long shot, a distant dream, but it was a dream worth fighting for.
