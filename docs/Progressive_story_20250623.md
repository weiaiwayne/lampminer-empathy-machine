The fluorescent hum of the DMV buzzed in Maya's ears, a dissonant soundtrack to her anxiety. Her hands, slick with sweat, clutched the I-94 form – a fragile shield against a world that felt increasingly hostile. Outside, the Texas sun beat down, a relentless reminder of the border, the checkpoints, the whispers of "illegal." 

Maya, a DACA recipient since she was practically a child, felt the ground shifting beneath her feet. The Reddit threads swam in her head: ICE raids, families separated, the constant fear etched on the faces of her community. Even Pedro Pascal, bless his heart, couldn't soothe the gnawing fear.

She watched a young woman, clearly Latina, arguing with the clerk behind the glass. The woman's voice, laced with desperation, was swallowed by the sterile air. Maya knew that desperation. It was the taste of uncertainty, the fear of being erased.

Suddenly, a memory flared: her Abuela's calloused hands kneading masa, the scent of tamales filling their tiny apartment. That was her anchor, her proof of belonging. But would it be enough?

She thought of her friends, a patchwork of asylum seekers, H1B visa holders, and green card applicants, all navigating a labyrinth of paperwork and bureaucratic nightmares. They were doctors, artists, students – people building lives, contributing to a nation that simultaneously welcomed and rejected them.

A knot tightened in her stomach. She thought of the young man, the multi-millionaire TikToker, detained by ICE. Money, fame, it didn't matter. They were all vulnerable. 

Maya's name was called. She straightened her shoulders, took a deep breath, and walked towards the window. She would answer every question truthfully, armed with her I-94, her DACA card, and the fierce love for the only home she's ever known. She would fight for her place, for her right to exist, even as the hum of the fluorescent lights echoed the relentless anxiety in her heart. The fight for justice, for equity, for her community, was far from over.
