The hum of the server room was a constant, throbbing reminder of the digital walls I built and inhabited. Outside, the real world was a glitching mess of asylum hearings, H1B anxieties, and the creeping fear of ICE. I scanned Reddit threads, a digital tapestry woven with the hopes and anxieties of those seeking a piece of the American Dream, a dream I fiercely believed in, but one that seemed increasingly fragile.

A young woman, the only US citizen in her office, was shuttling her colleagues to asylum hearings. I imagined her, a beacon of American compassion in a sea of bureaucratic red tape. Then there was the Afghan husband, arriving alone, burdened by his nationality and a language barrier, facing a hostile border. These were the stories that fueled my own convictions.

The thread about birthright citizenship gnawed at me. Europe, those socialist hellholes, didn't offer it. Why should we? The Fourteenth Amendment was sacred, but fiscal responsibility was too. The weight of endless obligations, the unchecked flow across our borders… it threatened the very exceptionalism I championed.

A flicker of anger ignited as I read about the woman blackmailed by her green card seeking spouse. These stories, too, were woven into the tapestry – the dark threads of exploitation and broken promises. Did she sign, or did she lawyer up?

Yet, amidst the anxieties and the potential for abuse, there was resilience. The MMA fighter seeking sponsorship, the student on an F1 visa navigating a serious car accident, the desperate search for a good immigration lawyer – they were all fighting for their slice of the American pie.

Pedro Pascal, the virtue signaling actor, yammering on about deportations. What a load of horse manure.

The system was broken, I knew. But not beyond repair. We needed secure borders, yes, but also a clear path for those who would contribute, who embraced our values. We needed to streamline the process, crack down on fraud, and restore faith in the promise of American opportunity. It was a tall order, but I was a tech bro, goddammit. I believed in solving problems. And I believed in America.
