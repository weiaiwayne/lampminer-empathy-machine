The fluorescent hum of the Home Depot parking lot buzzed in my ears, mirroring the anxiety thrumming in my chest. I was driving Maria and her son, Mateo, to her final asylum hearing. Maria, a wisp of a woman with eyes that held the weight of a shattered life in Venezuela, gripped Mateoâ€™s hand so tight her knuckles were white. Mateo, all of seven years old, was drawing rockets on a napkin, oblivious to the stakes.

"Don't worry, Maria," I said, trying to sound more confident than I felt. "America is the land of opportunity. They'll see you're a good person, a hard worker."

My words felt hollow, even to me. I remembered the endless Reddit threads, the stories of shattered dreams and bureaucratic nightmares. I thought about the guy on the forum, the one who'd sunk everything into FAA certification, desperately hoping it would be enough to tip the scales in his favor after 11 years of uncertainty.

We pulled up to the courthouse, a hulking concrete monument to a system that felt both powerful and indifferent. Inside, the air was thick with fear and desperation. Families huddled together, whispering in hushed tones. Lawyers, sharp-suited and weary, navigated the labyrinthine corridors.

I sat with Maria and Mateo, watching Mateo's rockets slowly turn into tanks. The wait stretched on, each minute an eternity. Finally, Maria was called. I squeezed her hand, offering a silent prayer to a God I wasn't even sure I believed in anymore.

Hours later, she emerged, her face a mask of devastation. Denied. The judge, unmoved by her story, had given her a removal date. Mateo, sensing the shift in the atmosphere, started to cry.

As we walked back to the car, the setting sun cast long shadows across the parking lot. The American Dream, I thought, was often just a mirage in the desert, shimmering with promise but ultimately unattainable for so many. I glanced at Mateo, his small face streaked with tears. I knew, with a certainty that chilled me to the bone, that this country, my country, was failing him. It was failing Maria. And in that moment, I felt a rage building inside me, a burning desire to tear down the walls and build something better, something truly just. But all I could do was buckle Mateo into his car seat and drive them home, the silence broken only by his quiet sobs.
