Okay, so, like, I was scrolling through Reddit the other day, right? Trying to find a good deal on a new RTX 5080 (when they actually drop, ugh), and I stumbled into some of those immigration subs. Honestly, it's a rabbit hole.

First, there's this dude freaking out about his dad maybe getting deported because he’s working without papers. Then there's a girl who's scared to take her kid to Disney World because her wife doesn’t have status, and she's scared of ICE. It's like, chill, lady, it's Disney! But also, like, not chill, because the fear is real, you know?

Then I saw this thread about someone who got married, and now their spouse is blackmailing them with the green card application. And another one about a guy who came here as a kid and has been waiting for asylum for a decade, and now he’s in college and terrified of getting sent back.

It's a mess. A total, absolute mess. And I'm just sitting here, eating my Hot Pockets, thinking about frame rates and wondering if I should upgrade my RAM.

I mean, I feel bad, obviously. It’s rough out there. But what am I supposed to do? I'm just trying to live my life, you know? Get a good job, maybe buy a Tesla someday, post some fire memes. Politics are just...ugh. Too much.

And like, I'm not saying it's *their* fault or anything. It's just...complicated. I saw one thread about birthright citizenship, and some dude on a visa was saying it should be dismantled to save the country from financial ruin. *Dismantled!* Dude, just chill out and enjoy the freedom, or go back where you came from.

It's all so heavy. Makes you wanna just log off and binge-watch "Rick and Morty" until the world stops spinning. But then you remember you need to check r/buildapc for those GPU deals… and the cycle continues.
