The hum of the server room was my lullaby. Rows of blinking lights, the thrum of cooling fans â€“ this was the real America, the engine room of innovation. Not the woke pronouncements from Silicon Valley suits, but the raw power churning beneath.

I scanned the Reddit threads, a digital vigilante sifting through the noise. A kid scared for his undocumented father, a woman struggling with the ghosts of a lost home, another drowning in bureaucratic quicksand just trying to become a citizen. Each story a data point, a testament to a system gamed by globalists and bleeding-heart liberals.

This wasn't the American Dream my parents sold me. They came here chasing opportunity, and found it, damn it. They didn't whine about cultural bereavement or expect handouts. They worked, they built, they contributed. Now, it's a free-for-all, a race to the bottom fueled by cheap labor and identity politics.

I thought of the Caracalla article. Citizenship for all! Sounds great on paper, but what about the cost? Rome crumbled, didn't it? Diluted, weakened from within. The same thing's happening here. Open borders, sanctuary cities, and activist judges are eroding the foundations of this nation.

The Venezuelan man tackled in the courthouse flashed in my mind. Zero empathy? Maybe. Or maybe it was the raw, visceral reaction to the chaos flooding our streets. The man broke the law. The law exists for a reason.

I closed the Reddit tabs, the digital voices fading into the background. The solution wasn't more empathy, more hand-wringing, more excuses. It was simple: secure the border, enforce the laws, and put America first. Not some globalist utopia, but the America that built the Hoover Dam, put a man on the moon, and dominated the world stage.

I adjusted the thermostat in the server room, the cool air a stark contrast to the simmering anger in my gut. The work never ends. The fight never stops. The future of America depends on it.
