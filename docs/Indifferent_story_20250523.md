The meme scrolled by, another bewildered Shiba Inu staring into the abyss of late-stage capitalism. I chuckled, but the sound felt hollow in my ears. My phone buzzed – another Reddit notification. This time, it was about some dude's green card interview getting canceled, shipped off to Cincinnati like an unwanted package.

Cincinnati. I knew a guy who went there once. Said it was alright. I wouldn't know. Never been outside the state, really.

All this immigration stuff swirls around online, a constant undercurrent to the cat videos and tech reviews. Asylum hearings, visa lotteries, birthright citizenship debates... it's like a real-life Sims game, but with way higher stakes. People's lives hanging in the balance, all dependent on paperwork and interviews and some dude in a government office having a good day.

I get it, kinda. Everyone wants a better life. New phone, new car, new country – it's all the same dopamine chase. But some of these stories... the guy who got blackmailed after getting married, the family stuck in limbo waiting for a waiver, the Afghan dude flying solo into the unknown... they hit different.

It's easy to stay detached, binge-watching Netflix and arguing about graphics cards. But then you see these glimpses of real struggle, real fear. Like that guy, venting about his asylum interview, 11 years in the US with no certainty. I almost felt something.

Maybe I should care more. Maybe I should learn more. But then another meme pops up – a distracted boyfriend looking at a new phone while his girlfriend fumes. I snorted. Priorities, right?

I wonder if they make a phone that can solve the immigration crisis. Probably not. Probably just one with a better camera. And maybe that's all that matters anyway. A good photo, a funny meme, a distraction from the void. At least until the next Reddit notification.
