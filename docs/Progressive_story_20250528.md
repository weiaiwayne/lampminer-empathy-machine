The fluorescent hum of the clinic buzzed in my ears, a soundtrack to anxiety. Maria sat across from me, her hands clasped tight, a map of worry etched on her face. Monday, the asylum hearing. After eleven years, after navigating a maze of paperwork and bureaucratic indifference, it all came down to this. I squeezed her hand, trying to project an optimism I didn’t entirely feel. Criminal court was a brutal ballet of delays and indifference, but this felt different, more personal.

I pictured her son, little Miguel, waiting in the car. He deserved a mother free from the shadow of deportation. I thought of the Reddit threads I’d been scouring, the stories of families ripped apart, the desperation of those clinging to the American dream by a thread. It fueled my anger, a simmering resentment against a system that valued paperwork over humanity.

Tuesday, the declaration. Another life hanging in the balance. This time, it was about supporting someone’s claim, standing up and saying, “This person deserves to be here.” But what did that even *mean* in a country where birthright citizenship was debated, where Stephen Miller was still slinging hate, where a “minor mistake” on a medical form could derail years of effort?

The stories swirled in my head: the H1B worker juggling visas, the student praying for a scholarship, the DACA recipient facing an interview. Each a testament to resilience, each a condemnation of a system rigged against them.

I looked at Maria again, her eyes filled with a quiet fear. I thought of Pedro Pascal at Cannes, using his platform to speak out against deportations. It wasn't enough, but it was something.

"We'll be there, Maria," I said, my voice firm. "We'll be there every step of the way."

Because what else could I do? In a world of endless forms, arbitrary rules, and systemic injustice, all I had was my voice, my presence, and a burning desire to fight for a better world. A world where Maria could finally breathe easy, where Miguel could grow up knowing his mother was safe, where the promise of America wasn't just a lie whispered in the dark.
