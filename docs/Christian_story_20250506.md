The scent of burnt coffee clung to the air, a persistent reminder of the late-night Reddit dives. I closed my Bible, its worn leather a familiar comfort, and glanced out the window. The morning light, fractured by the blinds, mimicked the fractured narratives swirling in my head.

I'd been wrestling with the story of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the man wrongly deported, and his wife forced into hiding. It felt like a modern-day parallel to the exiles of the Old Testament, driven from their homes, their families scattered. But this wasn't Babylon; this was America, a nation founded on ideals of justice and welcome, a city on a hill. Yet, the hill seemed to be crumbling.

The narratives clashed within me: the hopeful stories of green card approvals, the desperate pleas for help navigating bureaucratic mazes, and the chilling accounts of families torn apart. I thought of the second-generation American, grappling with the realities of discrimination and economic hardship, a stark contrast to the "American Dream" sold to his parents.

Caracalla's edict echoed faintly: citizenship for all, a grand gesture of unity. But unity at what cost? And what about those who, like the mother-in-law in Texas, use the system for their own twisted ends? Where was the justice for the abused father-in-law, wrongly deported?

I felt a familiar pang of unease. The threads of these stories, woven together, created a tapestry of fear, hope, and disillusionment. The world seemed to be in rebellion against God's order. The call to love our neighbor, to welcome the stranger, felt increasingly complex in this climate of legal loopholes and political maneuvering.

I opened my Bible again, seeking solace in the unchanging Word. "Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good." Romans 12:21. It was a simple directive, yet immeasurably difficult to enact in a world so steeped in complexity.

Perhaps, the answer wasn't in grand pronouncements or sweeping policy changes, but in the small acts of compassion and advocacy. Helping a friend navigate the confusing immigration system, offering a listening ear to someone struggling with cultural bereavement, praying for the wrongly accused. These were the seeds of righteousness, planted in the fertile ground of faith, watered by the grace of God. These were the ways I could strive to be a light in the darkness, trusting that even in the midst of chaos, God's ultimate plan would prevail.
