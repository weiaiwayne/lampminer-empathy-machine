The flickering neon sign of the "Lone Star Diner" buzzed outside, casting a sickly green glow on the rain-slicked highway. Inside, I nursed a lukewarm coffee, the kind that tastes like regret and burnt metal. My phone buzzed with another Reddit thread – "Looking for legal ways to stay in the U.S. as a Canadian citizen." Always the same story. People yearning for something just out of reach, chasing the American Dream like a mirage in the desert.

Across from me, a young woman with tired eyes stared blankly at a stack of pamphlets – "Asylum Seekers' Rights," "Know Your Legal Options." She clutched a worn teddy bear, its fur matted and faded. Probably fresh off the bus from some border town, clutching onto hope like that bear. I knew the look. I'd seen it a hundred times, in the faces of the H1B hopefuls, the DV lottery winners, the DREAMers clinging to DACA. All chasing the same promise, the same idea that America is still the land of opportunity.

But is it? I wondered, swirling the dregs of my coffee. Pedro Pascal can spout platitudes at Cannes, but that doesn't change the reality. The system's clogged, backlogged, and rigged. Lawyers are getting rich off desperate people, and the politicians are playing games with their lives. Even my own kin from the north are yearning for a piece of the pie.

I thought about my own grandfather, who came here with nothing but a suitcase and a dream. He built a life, a business, a legacy. Could he do it today? I honestly didn't know. The rules have changed, the goalposts have moved. The promise feels hollower, the path steeper.

I finished my coffee, the bitter taste lingering on my tongue. I pulled out my phone and typed a quick reply to the Canadian kid's post: "Get a good lawyer. And be prepared to fight." It wasn't much, but it was the only advice I had to offer. Out in the rain, an 18-wheeler roared past, its lights blurring into streaks of red and white. Another truckload of dreams heading down the highway, hoping to find a place to park.
