Okay, so like, people are stressed. Super stressed. I'm seeing it all over the place. Asylum interviews, visa applications, green card hopes hanging by a thread. It's a whole mess of paperwork and waiting, and honestly, it sounds like the opposite of chill.

Here's my story:

The notification chimed, a cheerful little sound completely at odds with the knot in Anya's stomach. "IOE09280 - Case Status Updated." She'd been refreshing the USCIS site so often her browser probably thought she was a bot. Anya tapped the screen, the sterile white page blooming with the same damn message: "Case is being actively reviewed." Actively reviewed for *how long*?

She tossed the phone onto the worn couch, the springs groaning in protest. Her U4U status felt like a temporary tattoo, slowly fading, reminding her of a life on pause. Back in Kyiv, sheâ€™d been a coder, building sleek interfaces, lost in the logic of algorithms. Now, she was staring at a screen, her fate decided by bureaucrats she'd never meet.

Outside, the American suburbs stretched, a grid of green lawns and identical houses. It was safe, quiet, everything Ukraine wasn't. But safety felt like a gilded cage when her husband was still dodging missiles, when her parents were rationing dwindling supplies.

Anya scrolled through Instagram, a curated stream of smiling faces, avocado toast, and inspirational quotes. It was a world away from the reality she knew, a world where a misplaced comma on a medical exam could derail your future. She saw a meme: a dog sitting in a burning house, saying "This is fine." She almost laughed. Almost.

Then, a news alert popped up: a tech company was offering remote coding jobs, no degree required. Anya felt a flicker of hope, a tiny spark in the digital wasteland of her anxiety. Maybe, just maybe, she could reclaim a piece of her old life, even here, even waiting. Maybe she could build something, even if her future remained a glitch in the system.
