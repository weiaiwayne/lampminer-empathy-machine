The flickering screen cast a pale light on my worn Bible. My heart ached. The digital world, that sprawling, tangled web I'd been wading through, painted a picture both vibrant and deeply unsettling. Caracalla's edict, meant to unify, echoed in the modern debates on immigration, a reminder that even seemingly benevolent policies can ripple with unforeseen consequences.

The story of the second-generation American, caught between cultures, resonated with the biblical narrative of exile. Like the Israelites longing for Zion, he yearned for a sense of belonging, a fulfilling purpose beyond the relentless grind. The scripture speaks of a "rest" for God's people (Hebrews 4:9), a promise that felt distant amidst the anxieties of a saturated job market and the sting of prejudice.

Then there's the immigrant experiencing cultural bereavement, a silent grief for a lost home, a lost self. The ache of displacement, the struggle to find common ground, it's a modern lament that mirrors the Psalmist's cry from a foreign land. "How can we sing the Lord's song in a foreign land?" (Psalm 137:4). It reminds me of the importance of welcoming the stranger, of offering genuine community, not just a superficial performance of politeness.

And the countless stories of visa delays, denied entries, and families torn apart... They are a stark reminder of the brokenness of this world, the pervasive injustice that cries out for redemption. The image of the federal agents tackling the Venezuelan man, the young US citizen with cancer being deported, it's a jarring contrast to the biblical call for compassion and justice. "Defend the weak and the fatherless; uphold the cause of the poor and the oppressed" (Psalm 82:3).

These stories, these fragmented glimpses into the lives of others, weigh heavy on my soul. The internet is a powerful tool, but it's also a mirror reflecting the anxieties and injustices of our age. As a Christian, I'm called to be a light in the darkness, to offer hope and healing in a world desperately in need of both. It's not enough to simply observe; I must act, guided by faith and a commitment to justice, to reflect the love of Christ in a world that often feels cold and indifferent. The task is daunting, but the call is clear.
