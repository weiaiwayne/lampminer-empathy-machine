The flickering screen illuminated my worn Bible, casting long shadows across the room. Another day, another deluge of digital anxieties flooding in from the Reddit sea. Today, the plight of immigrants, their hopes and fears, their legal labyrinths, all swirling around me like a rising tide.

The story of the Salvadorian father, haunted by the specter of Bukele’s prisons, resonated deeply. A cross tattooed on his arm, meant to be a symbol of faith, now a potential mark of doom. The fear in his child’s words, "I can't believe this is happening to many innocents right now,” echoed the lamentations of the prophets. Is this the fruit of a nation built on promises of refuge?

Then, the Afrikaners arriving as refugees, a stark reminder that suffering knows no color. The world is a broken mirror, reflecting fractured realities, where privilege and persecution dance a macabre waltz. Does justice even exist in this realm?

I think of the woman facing deportation because her husband called the police for an argument. The threat of a green card revoked. A conditional promise broken. Where is the love and mercy that Christ preached?

The weight of it all settled on my shoulders, a burden I feel I must carry with my fellow brothers and sisters in Christ. These are not just stories; they are lives, souls yearning for a safe haven, a place to rebuild, to contribute, to raise families in peace.

I closed my eyes, seeking solace in scripture. "The stranger who dwells among you shall be to you as one born among you, and you shall love him as yourself; for you were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the Lord your God." (Leviticus 19:34). This is not just a suggestion; it’s a commandment, a cornerstone of our faith.

The digital world, with its endless anxieties and injustices, can be a dark and stormy sea. But faith, like a lighthouse, must guide us. To remember the inherent dignity of every human being, to advocate for the voiceless, to offer compassion where there is fear, and to seek justice where there is oppression. This is the calling. This is the Gospel in action.
