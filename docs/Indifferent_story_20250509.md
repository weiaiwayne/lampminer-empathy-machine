The meme of the horse being deported from Texas keeps flashing in my head. Like, what even *is* that? Is it supposed to be funny? Tragic? Just another Tuesday? I scroll past it, another wave of anxiety washing over me. It's always about immigration, isn't it? Either people struggling, getting scammed, or the government being… well, the government.

I see a post about a green card holder, a Canadian, terrified of visiting family because of the new administration. Like, chill out, eh? You're legal. Probably. But then I remember reading about that Maryland guy, *wrongfully* deported. His wife, now living in a safe house because the DHS doxed her address. What the actual fuck?

And then there's the endless stream of people trying to navigate the labyrinth of visas, forms, and lawyers. F1, H1B, O1, L2, EAD… It all blurs together. Someone's J-1 got rejected. Someone else got an RFE so broad it's basically saying, "prove you exist." Someone is scared of being deported for a speeding ticket.

I glance at the clock. Time to clock in. My salaried job is already a 50-60 hour a week nightmare. The world is burning and all I can do is keep grinding, changing jobs every year or two, hoping for something that doesn't suck. Maybe I should learn how to code or something. AI is gonna take our jobs anyway.

I see a post about a woman in Texas trying to deport her mother-in-law. That's so messed up. I think about the 2nd generation American who feels like they don’t belong. The person grieving the country they left behind. It's all just… heavy.

I need a dopamine hit. I click on a thread about the best new tech gadgets. Maybe a new noise-cancelling headset will make the soul-crushing monotony of my job bearable. Or maybe I’ll just doomscroll through more memes until I fall asleep. At least then I won't have to think about any of this.
