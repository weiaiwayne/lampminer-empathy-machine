The flickering neon sign of the "American Dream Diner" cast a sickly yellow glow across the rain-slicked street. Inside, Maria nervously stirred her lukewarm coffee. Her husband, Eduardo, a mechanic with grease permanently etched under his fingernails, nervously chewed his lip. Tonight, they were celebrating – or rather, attempting to celebrate – their daughter’s acceptance to college. A first-generation triumph.

But the joy felt…tainted.

Maria’s mother-in-law, a volatile woman with eyes that could curdle milk, had called ICE on Eduardo’s brother last week, falsely claiming abuse. He was gone now, swallowed by the deportation machine. Maria couldn't help but wonder if her own family would be next.

Eduardo caught her eye, a flicker of fear mirroring her own. “Don't worry, mi amor,” he said, his voice rough. “We’ve done everything right.”

Maria wanted to believe him. They’d paid their taxes, kept their noses clean, and raised a daughter who embodied the American ideal. But the news was relentless: families torn apart, children deported with cancer, citizens wrongly swept up in the dragnet. The constant pressure to prove their worthiness, to exist in a state of perpetual anxiety, was exhausting.

Their daughter, Sofia, oblivious to the swirling anxieties, scrolled through college dorm photos on her phone, her face alight with excitement. Maria plastered on a smile, forcing herself to focus on Sofia’s future. This was what it was all for, wasn’t it?

As they left the diner, the rain had stopped, and a sliver of moon peeked through the clouds. Maria looked up, a silent prayer forming on her lips: please, just let us be. But the weight of the unknown, the fear of a knock on the door in the dead of night, lingered like a ghost, a stark reminder that even in America, the dream could shatter at any moment. The neon sign of the diner continued its tireless flicker, a broken promise in the dark.
