Okay, let's do this.

The meme feed flickered on the cracked screen of my old phone, another doge variation with a caption about student loan debt. I scrolled, vaguely registering the image, more interested in the faint hum of the air conditioner struggling against the Texas heat. Outside, the cicadas buzzed like a malfunctioning hard drive.

Heard some chatter about immigration stuff again on Reddit. Asylum, green cards, waivers... It's like a constant stream of anxiety. I feel bad for those people though. I saw a story of a dad who might get deported and might not see his kid again. Crazy!

I'm just trying to get through the day, ya know? New techâ€™s cool and all, but it's not gonna fix the broken ice cream machine at the local Wendy's. That's a real problem.

I swiped to a post about birthright citizenship. Some people are really angry about it. Like, *really* angry. I don't know man. Seem like it would cause a lot of problems.

I guess the world is a dumpster fire, but at least we have dank memes to laugh at while it burns. I just hope my phone doesn't run out of battery before the next drop of new gadgets.
