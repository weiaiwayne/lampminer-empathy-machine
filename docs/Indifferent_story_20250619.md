Okay, here's my attempt at a short story based on what I've gleaned from the Reddit firehose today:

The glow of the phone screen illuminated Anya's face, another meme about Trump 2.0 flickering and dying. She sighed, scrolling past desperate pleas for immigration advice, success stories peppered with anxiety, and the constant undercurrent of fear. It was all just noise, really, a digital white noise machine for the anxieties of the displaced.

Anya tapped on a news article: Khaby Lame, the king of the silent reaction, detained by ICE. Irony, she thought, the purest form of digital communication, shut down by bureaucratic silence. She chucked the phone on the couch, the screen now a dull mirror reflecting her own apathy.

Outside, the cicadas buzzed, a relentless, monotonous drone that mirrored the endless stream of information. The air hung thick with summer humidity, a Texas heat that felt oppressive even indoors. She was supposed to meet her friends later, the ones from the Discord server, the ones planning their collective move toâ€¦where was it? Some farm in Vermont? Anywhere but here.

But honestly, did it even matter? Europe, Canada, even freakin' New Zealand seemed to be having their own brand of chaos. The world was a glitching simulation, a poorly rendered video game where everyone was desperately trying to find the cheat code to a life that didn't suck.

She wandered into the kitchen, grabbed a bag of Takis, and ripped it open. The fiery dust coated her fingers, a small, familiar comfort. Maybe tonight she'd binge watch that new anime, the one with the cyborgs and the existential dread. At least *they* had cool weapons to deal with their problems.

Anya glanced at the stack of unopened mail on the counter. Probably just bills, maybe a coupon for Little Caesar's. She left it there, a monument to the things she didn't want to think about. For now, there were Takis, anime, and the faint, flickering hope that maybe, just maybe, tomorrow would be a slightly less glitchy day.
