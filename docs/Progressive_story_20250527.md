Rain lashed against the window of the community center, mirroring the storm brewing inside me. Tonight’s meeting was about the proposed zoning changes, designed to push out the last vestiges of affordable housing in our neighborhood. Gentrification, disguised as progress. Same old story.

I scrolled through Reddit on my cracked phone, a digital lifeline to the struggles of others. A young woman, driving immigrants to their asylum hearings, shouldering a burden the government refuses to carry. A student, terrified of visa rejection despite a full scholarship, caught in the Kafkaesque bureaucracy designed to keep the "undesirables" out. A desperate plea for help navigating the labyrinthine immigration system, a system that seems intentionally designed to break people.

It’s all connected, this web of injustice. The zoning laws, the visa denials, the deportations. It’s about power, about who gets to stay and who gets forced out, who gets to thrive and who gets left behind.

I thought of Pedro Pascal, using his platform to speak out against deportations. It’s not enough, but it’s something. We all need to be doing something.

An older woman, Maria, stood up to speak, her voice trembling slightly. She’s lived in this neighborhood her whole life, raised her children here. Now, she might lose her home. My anger flared. I knew Maria. I knew her story.

"They say it's progress," she said, her eyes scanning the room, "but progress for whom? Not for us."

Her words hung in the air, heavy with truth. I stood up, my own voice shaking at first, then gaining strength. "We can't let them do this," I said, "We have to fight back. We have to organize. We have to show them that we won't be erased."

The rain kept falling, but inside the community center, a spark had been ignited. A spark of resistance, of hope, fueled by the shared struggles of a community fighting for its survival. We have to fight for each other, the immigrants, the asylum seekers, the long-term residents, because we're all in this together, and nobody is free until everybody is free.
