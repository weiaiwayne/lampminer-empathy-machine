Okay, let's do this.

The glow of the phone illuminated my face, another late-night doomscroll through r/immigration. J-1 visas, EB2-NIW, ROC green cardsâ€¦ It was a goddamn alphabet soup of anxieties, each thread a miniature crisis. A Canadian au pair with a North Korean birth certificate, a wife in a safe house because the government doxxed her, a four-year-old with cancer getting deported. Jesus.

I swiped up, looking for a dopamine hit. Suddenly, the algorithm blessed me with a cute cat video. Better! But the guilt nipped. Should I be *doing* something? Like, actually *doing* something about all this injustice? Nah, too much effort. Probably just gonna end up on some government watchlist anyway.

I saw this post about a guy asking if it was okay to have a commitment ceremony before his green card was approved. Poor sap. Probably should just wait. I mean, I get it, love is great, but don't risk it, guy.

It's all so messed up, isn't it? People just trying to live their lives, get a decent job, raise a family, maybe even afford a new OLED TV. But there's always some bureaucratic bullshit, some racist policy, some random act of cruelty standing in the way.

I guess it's always been like this, hasn't it? Caracalla probably had his fair share of Reddit threads too. "Citizenship for everyone? What about the jobs?!" 

I sighed, closed the app, and glanced over at my shelf. I have a Nintendo Switch and a Steam Deck, both begging for attention. I need to get back to Elden Ring. At least in that world, the rules are clear. And the bad guys are monsters, not just pencil-pushers with bad intentions. 

Yeah, I'll worry about the immigration crisis tomorrow. Tonight, I'm slaying dragons. Maybe that makes me a bad person, but right now, it makes me a slightly less stressed one.
