Okay, let's do this.

The feed glows blue, another Reddit rabbit hole. Today it's immigration woes, a never-ending scroll of anxieties and bureaucratic nightmares. Caracalla's Edict? Sounds like a new iPhone feature no one asked for. Seriously, though, people are stressed. Deportations, visas, green cardsâ€¦ it's like a real-life escape room, but with the stakes being, you know, your entire life.

That second-gen South Asian dude? I feel him. Grind culture is real, and it doesn't care where you're from. Toxic workplaces, chasing the next gig... been there, meme'd that. The HCOL struggle is *definitely* real.

And that person grieving the US after being yanked back to a "third world country"? Oof. Cultural bereavement. Never thought about it like that. It's not just refugees; it's anyone ripped from a place they considered home. Makes you wonder what "home" even means anymore. Is it a place, or is it just... a vibe?

Then there's the raw fear. Fathers facing deportation, families torn apart. It's a constant undercurrent, a low hum of anxiety in the digital air. The agent tackling that Venezuelan dude? Brutal. Zero empathy, like the title says.

And the lady whose wife is convinced getting a marriage green card is impossible? Man, the system really messes with people's heads.

Honestly, it's all a bit much. Makes you wanna just unplug, buy a cabin in the woods, and learn to code or something. But then you remember there's probably no wifi in the woods, and you'd miss the memes.

So, you keep scrolling. Maybe you'll see a cool gadget review next, or a funny cat video. Gotta find the balance, right? Doomscrolling and chill. That's the modern way.
