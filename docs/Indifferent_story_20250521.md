The notification chimed, a little fanfare heralding another Reddit post. This one was about some poor sap whose I-485 was stuck in limbo. "Case Approved," it said, mocking him, but no actual green card in sight. Reminded me of that loading screen in Cyberpunk that never quite finished.

I scrolled past, mind already drifting. My brain felt like a browser with too many tabs open. Asylum hearings, visa rejections, birthright citizenship debates...It was all noise. Important noise, maybe, but noise nonetheless. I needed a dopamine hit.

I flipped over to r/MechanicalKeyboards. Ah, there it was: a custom build with GMK Botanical keycaps and a brass plate. The thocc, the feel... pure ASMR for the fingers. A comment thread debated the merits of linear vs. tactile switches. This, this was something I could actually *understand*.

Later, while microwaving leftover pizza, I caught a snippet of the news. Something about immigration reform, or maybe it was just another politician bloviating. I muted it. The pizza smelled good, and I had a date with a new roguelike game.

But later, lying in bed, the Reddit threads flickered in my memory. The Afghan national nervous about travel, the DACA recipient facing an interview…faces and stories swimming in the digital ether. I didn’t *want* to care, really. My life was fine. But a tiny thread of empathy snagged in my apathy.

I thought about the sheer *effort* these people were putting in to navigate this maze of bureaucracy, the anxiety, the constant uncertainty.  It was like trying to beat a Dark Souls boss with a broken controller.

I pulled out my phone. Maybe I'd just skim through some more Reddit, find a meme about it. Distraction. That's what I needed. Maybe tomorrow I would finally look into buying that new graphics card.
