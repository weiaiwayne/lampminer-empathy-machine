Okay, here's my take:

The meme scrolled past on r/all, another bewildered Pikachu face photoshopped onto a news headline about some family getting split up at the border. I didn't even flinch. It was just... Tuesday.

My phone buzzed, a notification from Slickdeals. A refurbished Roomba i7 was down to $250. *Now* that got my attention. Vacuuming sucked. Literally.

Later, while waiting for the Roomba to arrive (same-day delivery, bless Amazon), I absentmindedly scrolled through r/immigration. A girl was freaking out because her mom, a citizen for 50 years, thought Trump was gonna deport her. Lol. My own grandma barely knew how to use a flip phone, let alone worry about QAnon conspiracies. Maybe I should show her the new TikTok dances instead.

Then came a thread about someone's FIL getting deported because his MIL called the cops on him. The comments were a mess, half calling her a monster, half saying "play stupid games, win stupid prizes." I just sighed. People were so quick to take sides, so sure they knew everything.

The doorbell rang. Roomba time. As I wrestled it out of the box, I thought about that family. My own family came here generations ago, no problems. Lucky, I guess. It's not like *I* could fix anything. I'm just here for the deals.

I set the Roomba free in my apartment, christening it "DJ Roomba." It bumped happily against the furniture, sucking up dust bunnies with cheerful obliviousness. Maybe that was the key: just keep cleaning, keep moving, keep the dust off the surface. Don't think too hard about what's underneath.

I queued up some vaporwave and started browsing for a new mechanical keyboard. Gotta have the right clicky-clack for maximum productivity. The world might be falling apart, but at least my apartment would be clean, and my WPM would be on point.
