The meme of the distracted boyfriend flickered across my phone screen, a momentary distraction from the Reddit rabbit hole. Immigration threads. Always immigration threads. It's the algorithm, man. It *knows* I read that article comparing Caracalla's edict to modern policy, even though I mostly skimmed it for the historical context.

Sarah, my Roomba, bumped gently against my leg. Time to empty her bin, another pressing matter.

Scrolling through the headlines, a story about a wrongly deported guy in Maryland. Jesus. Then another about a cancer patient, a kid, getting deported. The sheer *wrongness* of it buzzed in my brain like a faulty charger. Not that I'm gonna chain myself to a fence or anything. It's just... messed up.

I remember that one thread from the 2nd gen American, the burnout. Two master's degrees and still getting the shaft. HCOL, toxic workplaces. The American Dream, more like the American Hustle. Makes you wonder if that green card lottery is really worth it, ya know?

Then there's the flip side: the couple planning to move from Germany, full of hope but also scared. That's the thing, isn't it? Hope and fear, all tangled up.

I glance at my half-finished coding project. A program that generates random, increasingly absurd cat memes. More important than immigration policy? Maybe not. More immediately gratifying? Definitely.

A notification pops up from my smart fridge: "Milk expiring tomorrow." Fucking priorities. This is my life, right here. Milk, memes, and a vague sense of unease about the state of the world. I'll probably read another Reddit thread before bed, maybe even doomscroll through some political takes. But for now? I gotta salvage that milk. Gotta keep the chaos at bay, one expiration date at a time.
