The flickering neon sign of "Silicon Dreams" cast a sickly green glow across my Tesla's dashboard. Rain lashed against the panoramic roof, mirroring the storm brewing inside me. Caracalla, huh? Some history professor trying to draw parallels between ancient Rome and our glorious republic. The audacity! He probably thinks open borders are a net positive, just like that second-gen whiner on Reddit.

This kid, born with a silver spoon, complaining about the "toxic work environment" and the "grind." Newsflash, kid: life *is* a grind! My grandfather came here with nothing, worked his ass off, built a business. Nobody handed him a participation trophy. Now this kid, with his fancy healthcare degree and his tech skills, wants a fulfilling social life and "reasonable work-life balance." Entitled much?

Caracalla's edict...more like Caracalla's blunder. Diluting the core. Weakening the empire. Just like what's happening here. We're letting everyone in, and suddenly, everyone wants a handout. Nobody wants to build anything. Nobody wants to sacrifice. They just want to complain about discrimination and high cost of living.

I gripped the steering wheel tighter. The rain intensified. The Tesla hummed, a sterile, emotionless machine in a world drowning in manufactured outrage and woke nonsense. I'd built my company from the ground up, coding late nights, sleeping on the floor of my garage. Nobody gave me anything. And now, these virtue-signaling academics and whiny millennials want to tear it all down, redistribute the wealth, and turn America into some socialist paradise.

No. Not on my watch. We need to return to the values that made this country great. Hard work, personal responsibility, and a healthy dose of American exceptionalism. Build the wall, drain the swamp, and make America great again. That's the only edict we need. The green neon reflected in my eyes, hard and determined. The storm raged on, but inside, I felt a flicker of defiance, a spark of the old American spirit. The spirit that built empires, not diluted them.
