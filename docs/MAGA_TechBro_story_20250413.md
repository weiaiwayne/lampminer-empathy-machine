The ghost of Caracalla haunts the servers. I see his edict, digitized, flitting across the screen in a Reddit thread. He thought he was unifying the Empire, but all he did was dilute the pure Roman blood, open the gates to barbarians who didn't understand the glory of the legions. Sounds familiar, doesn't it?

Then I see the kid, born here, South Asian parents. Heâ€™s grinding, working 60-hour weeks, jumping from job to job. He's got the education, the skills, but he's still facing discrimination, still struggling with the HCOL. He's doing everything "right," but the system's rigged. The swamp is deep. He should be thriving in the greatest nation on Earth, but woke ideology and the globalist agenda are holding him back.

And then there's the other one, yanked back to some third-world shithole after a decade in the States. "Cultural bereavement," they call it. He tasted freedom, saw what America *could* be, and now he's trapped in a place where individuality is a crime. He's right, there's no grief like that. The grief of losing a potential future, of seeing the shining city on a hill crumble before your eyes.

The German dude, scared to come here because of "the political situation." They don't understand. This isn't about politics, it's about the soul of a nation. It's about preserving what makes America exceptional, about fighting back against the forces that want to erase our history, our culture, our values.

These stories, they're all connected. They're echoes of the same struggle: the struggle to maintain a strong, sovereign nation in a world that wants to tear it down. Caracalla opened the floodgates, and we're still dealing with the consequences. We need to build the wall, not just on the border, but in our minds, in our hearts. We need to reclaim our heritage, our identity, our destiny. Make America Great Again. It's not just a slogan, it's a fight for survival.
