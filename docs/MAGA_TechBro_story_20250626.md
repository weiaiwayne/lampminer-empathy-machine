The flickering neon sign of the "American Dream Diner" cast a sickly yellow glow on the rain-slicked street. Inside, Maria, a DREAMer since she was a toddler, nervously stirred her coffee. Her asylum hearing was tomorrow, and she was driving her coworkers, all immigrants, to their hearings. The only US-born citizen at her job, she felt a heavy responsibility.

Across from her, Javier scrolled through Reddit on his phone, muttering about birthright citizenship. "It's financial ruin, I tell ya! These anchor babies are gonna bankrupt us!" Maria bristled. She was no anchor baby. She was a hard worker, a taxpayer, a *person*.

"Easy, Javier," I said, taking a swig of my lukewarm coffee. "Not everyone born here is a drain on the system. Some of us actually contribute." I adjusted my "MAGA TechBro" hat, subtly reminding him of myâ€¦ leanings.

The diner door chimed, and in walked Elena, clutching a worn photo of her family in Ukraine. She was here on U4U, but the uncertainty was eating her alive. "I'm thinking of opening a subsidiary of our Ukrainian company," she said, her voice trembling. "L-1 visa, maybe? Anything's better than this limbo."

I scoffed, remembering my own struggles to get sponsored. "Good luck with that, sister. The system's rigged against ya. You gotta have connections, money... or a sob story that tugs at the heartstrings."

Maria glared at me. "Don't be like that. There's always hope."

Hope. A word that felt increasingly hollow these days. The news was a constant barrage of ICE raids, deportation orders, and political squabbles. Even Pedro Pascal was weighing in on the issue.

"Hope doesn't pay the bills," I muttered, pulling out my phone. Time to check the crypto markets. Maybe I could buy myself a ticket to New Zealand, where they're actually sane and not being held hostage by orange man.

But beneath the cynicism, a flicker of something else stirred. Guilt? Empathy? Maybe a tech bro can only be so heartless. I looked at Maria, at Elena, at Javier, at all these people who were just trying to build a life in this crazy, messed-up country. And for a moment, I felt a pang of something close to solidarity.

Nah, just indigestion. I ordered another coffee. The American Dream, after all, came with a hefty price tag.
