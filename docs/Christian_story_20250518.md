The fluorescent hum of the church basement was a constant, a low drone beneath the cacophony of anxieties buzzing in my own head. I see them in the pews, these faces etched with hope and fear, each a testament to the brokenness of this world and the enduring, often bewildering, grace of God.

Young Miguel, clutching his DACA application like a lifeline, his eyes darting around as we discuss his options. His parents brought him here as a baby, fleeing a life I can barely fathom, and now he's caught in the tangled web of bureaucracy. I pray for him, for a path cleared by justice and compassion, not just legality.

Then there's Svetlana, a whirlwind of energy and determination, dreaming of building a life here after escaping the horrors of Ukraine. She wants to open a business, contribute, *build*. But the L-1 visa seems like a distant star, and the complexities of immigration law feel like a wall closing in. I remind her of the parable of the mustard seed, of how faith, even the smallest amount, can blossom into something mighty.

And the young student, bright-eyed and hungry for knowledge, hoping a scholarship can open the door to a new life. Will they see past the "immigrant intent" clause? Will they see the potential, the yearning to contribute? I pray they will see the image of God reflected in this young soul, a divine spark that deserves to be nurtured.

These stories, gleaned from online whispers and whispered anxieties in the church basement, weigh heavy on my heart. They remind me that the church's call isn't just to preach salvation, but to advocate for justice, to extend a hand to the vulnerable, to be a beacon of hope in a world often shrouded in darkness. It's a daunting task, one that requires constant prayer, discernment, and a unwavering commitment to God's love. The world is a confusing place, full of broken systems and human failings, but I believe that through faith and action, we can be instruments of God's grace, helping to mend the broken pieces, one soul at a time.
