Okay, here's my attempt at a short story based on my Reddit deep dive, filtered through my apathy and love of shiny things:

The loading bar taunted me. 99%. Just like that asylum seeker probably felt, waiting for the hammer to drop. Except my existential dread was brought to you by iOS 18. Finally, the update finished, and I swiped through the predictably rearranged icons. Still no fix for the battery drain. Figures.

Reddit was blowing up about some new birthright citizenship thing. Honestly, I skimmed it. Seemed like more political screaming, and my brain was already maxed out on processing the optimal RGB settings for my new LED strip lights. Immigrants, refugees, visas… it all blurred into a low-humming background noise. Like the fan on my overclocked rig.

Someone was complaining about their green card interview. Another was trapped in Mexico, lungs full of… something. It was all just data points on a vast, indifferent spreadsheet. Sad? Sure. But my feed was also full of cute cat videos and that guy who builds robots out of discarded toasters. Balance, right?

I scrolled past a post about a guy getting blackmailed by his wife after she got her green card application in motion. Ouch. That’s when my attention shifted to a new post from r/AITA: "AITA for telling my unemployed brother that his lack of ambition is stressing me out?"

The comments were a glorious dumpster fire. Now *this* was relatable. Real people problems, not some abstract immigration policy debate. I grabbed a bag of Takis and dove in. Maybe I should get a Nest cam and livestream my reactions. Content, right?

The world was burning, sure, but at least I had 500mbps internet and a lifetime supply of spicy snacks. Besides, Elon just tweeted about a new Neuralink update. Maybe someday, all this immigration stuff will just be a neatly organized file in my brain, easily accessible, but not, like, *emotionally* accessible. Until then, Takis and tech. That's my truth.
