The neon sign of the "Golden Corral" flickered outside, a siren song for weary travelers and families seeking cheap comfort. Inside, Maria stirred her coffee, the plastic spoon clinking against the thick ceramic. Her daughter, Sofia, a bright spark of nine years old, was sketching on a napkin, oblivious to the weight in Maria's chest.

Deported. The word echoed in her mind, a brand seared onto her soul. They were seeking cancer treatment for Sofia, her little fighter, and that was enough for them to be tossed aside, labeled, and ripped from the only home Sofia had ever known.

The news reports swirled in her mind: families torn apart, lives upended, a climate of fear tightening its grip. The tech bros cheered it on from their echo chambers, blind to the human cost, their algorithms reinforcing the narrative of "us" versus "them." Even the ones who claimed to be libertarian, were all about the freedom to exploit and discard.

Maria remembered the lawyer's words, a cold assessment of her chances, the mountain of paperwork, the impossible deadlines. She thought of the endless online forums, the desperate pleas for help, the heartbreaking stories of families separated by bureaucratic walls.

She looked at Sofia, her face illuminated by the faint glow of the drawing. She was sketching a superhero, a figure of strength and hope. Mariaâ€™s eyes tightened. She had to be strong. She had to fight. Not just for Sofia, but for all the others caught in this web of injustice.

She wouldn't let them erase her story, wouldn't let them silence her voice. She would organize, advocate, and resist. She would find the pro bono lawyers, the community organizers, the allies who still believed in the promise of America, the one that wasn't just for the privileged few.

Maria reached across the table and gently touched Sofia's hand. "What are you drawing, mi amor?" she asked, her voice thick with emotion.

Sofia looked up, her eyes shining. "It's for you, Mama. It's a super doctor. She's going to make me better."

Maria smiled, a flicker of defiance in her eyes. "She will, mi hija. She will."
