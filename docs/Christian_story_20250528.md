The flickering screen cast a pale light on my worn Bible. Another hour gone, another scroll through Reddit’s labyrinthine threads. Lord, give me discernment. The world clamors, a cacophony of anxieties and aspirations, all filtered through the digital ether.

Young dreamers, desperate for a foothold. A student with a full scholarship, eyes wide with hope, yet shadowed by the fear of denial. "Is the main reason usually the 214(b) immigrant intent clause?" The question hangs heavy, a testament to the system's inherent distrust. I pray for them, that they find grace and favor, that their dreams, however fragile, may take root in this land.

Then there’s the Afghan man, newly visaed, facing a solo journey. "Stories of people getting extra scrutiny because of their nationality." Fear, amplified by the news cycle, clings to him like a shroud. I remember Christ's words, "I was a stranger, and you welcomed me." Are we, as a nation, truly living up to that calling?

And the woman, trapped in a nightmare of abuse and legal battles, her abuser still free despite a deportation order. "I could use some advice." Her cry pierces the digital noise. Lord, give her strength, give her justice. The system, meant to protect, seems to have failed her.

I close the laptop, the glow fading, leaving me in the quiet of my study. The world is hurting, a mosaic of brokenness and hope, of fear and faith. The scriptures remind me, that we are called to be lights in the darkness, to offer comfort and support, to advocate for the vulnerable.

Perhaps I cannot solve the immigration crisis, nor alleviate all the suffering I see on the screen. But I can offer a ride to the asylum hearing, a prayer for the student, a word of encouragement to the fearful. I can strive to be a beacon of Christ's love, a small act of defiance against the darkness, a testament to the enduring power of hope.
