The fluorescent lights of the community center hummed, a discordant symphony to the anxieties swirling within me. Maria, face etched with worry, clutched my hand. Her asylum hearing was Monday, a terrifying showdown against a system designed to grind down hope. I squeezed back, offering what little solidarity I could muster. I'd been to court enough times, for enough people, to know the feeling â€“ the gut-wrenching uncertainty, the bureaucratic indifference.

Reddit threads swam in my head: the DV lottery winners navigating the F-2 visa maze, the student clinging to a 100% scholarship, the countless pleas for help, for a way to stay, to *live*.

Later that week, I sat with Anya, whose I-130 petition had been approved, only for her petitioner to pass away. The Kafkaesque bureaucracy refused to acknowledge her as a substitute, citing "privacy." How could privacy trump basic human decency? I felt the familiar rage, the frustration of watching lives get tangled in red tape, reduced to case numbers and legal jargon.

My own privilege, as a citizen, felt like a heavy cloak. I could move freely, speak my mind, advocate for change without fearing deportation. But the weight of responsibility was crushing. How could I stand by and watch as families were ripped apart, as dreams were shattered, as human potential was squandered?

That night, I scrolled through Pedro Pascal's words from Cannes, echoing in my mind. *Immigration and Deportation*

I saw a post about a couple considering self-deportation. I paused. I felt the weight of my own privilege. I need to do something.

I think about the family member who was tricked into a self deportation order. A chill ran down my spine. I had to do more.

I closed my laptop, the glow reflecting in my determined eyes. The fight for justice, for equity, for a system that values human lives above all else, was far from over. It was just beginning.
