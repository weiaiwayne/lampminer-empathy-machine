The flickering screen illuminated my worn Bible, open to Romans 13. "Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established.” A verse that weighs heavily on my heart these days, especially after the digital deluge I’ve been swimming in. Reddit, a swirling vortex of anxieties, hopes, and the raw, unfiltered human experience.

I see the desperation in the eyes of the Afghan husband, navigating the labyrinth of immigration alone. I pray for him, that he finds kindness and understanding, a reflection of God's grace in a bureaucratic world. And for the young couple co-signing a lease, trusting that their commitment will be recognized as genuine. I hope it is. Marriage is sacred, a covenant ordained by God, not a mere transaction for a green card.

Then there's the woman, terrified that her husband's past mistakes, now forgiven by the law, will resurface to haunt their future citizenship interview. I feel her fear, the constant, gnawing worry that the system, meant to offer sanctuary, might instead deliver a crushing blow. Justice, mercy, and truth – these are the pillars of God's kingdom, and I long to see them reflected in our earthly laws.

I read of families separated, lives uprooted, and dreams deferred. I see the anxieties of those on STEM OPT, their futures hanging precariously on the whims of the H1B lottery. And the young woman, seeking asylum after years in the US, facing a future unknown. I pray that God’s will be done in their lives, that they will be comforted during this journey.

The Word tells us to love our neighbor as ourselves, to welcome the stranger, and to care for the vulnerable. But the threads of nationalism and fear weave a tangled web, tempting us to prioritize our own comfort and security above the needs of others. The question plagues me, as I navigate the digital world, How can I be a light in this darkness? How can I reconcile the call to obey earthly authorities with the unwavering command to love and serve those in need?

Perhaps the answer lies not in easy solutions, but in persistent prayer, in acts of kindness, and in the unwavering belief that even in the midst of chaos, God's grace endures. Perhaps it is through my actions, no matter how small, that I can show God's love. The screen dims, but the questions remain, etched in my heart, a constant reminder of the broken world we inhabit and the urgent need for God's healing touch.
