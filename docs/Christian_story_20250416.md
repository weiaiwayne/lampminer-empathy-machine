The hammered brass cross on my father's arm gleamed under the harsh fluorescent lights of the garage. He was bent over a sputtering engine, his brow furrowed in concentration, oblivious to the news reports flickering on the radio – reports of tightened borders, of promises made and threats implied. He was just trying to fix a car, earn an honest living, the same as he had for the past twenty years.

My heart clenched. I knew that cross was a symbol of his faith, a testament to the hope he carried, but lately, it felt like a target painted on his back. The stories I read online, the anxieties whispered in the community, painted a bleak picture. Bukele's CECOT prison loomed large in my mind, a modern-day Golgotha for the unwanted. The thought of my father, a gentle man who found solace in the Psalms and grease under his fingernails, trapped in such a place twisted my gut.

I worry for my father's soul as well. Is he truly saved? I pray he is, but I know that earthly justice is but a shadow of the divine.

The Reddit posts echoed in my mind. The second-generation immigrant, grinding away, facing discrimination despite their fluency and qualifications. The grief of a lost homeland, the yearning for belonging. The stark reality of migration, the emotional toll of displacement and the struggle for acceptance.

This is not the American dream that was promised. It is a land where hard work is not always enough, where fear can overshadow hope, where the scales of justice seem to tip precariously.

I picked up a wrench, offering it to my father. He smiled, a weary but genuine smile. In that moment, I saw not just a mechanic, but a man of faith, a provider, a father who had sacrificed everything for his family. I vowed, silently, to protect him, to fight for him, to remind him – and myself – that even in the face of fear, God's love endures. We will find strength in the scriptures, and we will pray for guidance.
