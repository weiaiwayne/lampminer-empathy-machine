The glow of my monitor illuminated the pre-dawn darkness of my home office. Another all-nighter fueled by caffeine and righteous indignation. I'd been diving deep into the digital trenches of Reddit, sifting through the digital detritus of modern life. This time, the topic was immigration.

Caracalla's edict… a Roman emperor extending citizenship to all free men. Sounds progressive, right? But history ain't always what it seems. It was a tax grab, a way to squeeze more coin from the conquered. And that's the problem with so-called "compassionate" policies. They're rarely altruistic. They're usually about power, control, or lining someone's pockets.

Then there's the second-generation kid, caught in the crossfire. Parents chasing the American Dream, him stuck with the reality of a saturated job market and woke discrimination. He's grinding, switching jobs, chasing the elusive promise. It's a tough pill to swallow, especially when you're raised on the myth of meritocracy.

And the immigrant grieving a phantom limb – a life left behind, a culture lost. It's a real struggle, a disconnect that no amount of "diversity training" can fix. This "cultural bereavement" is real. People are ripped away from their culture only to be told to assimilate, when it doesn't work that way. 

The truth is, uncontrolled immigration is a disaster waiting to happen. It strains resources, depresses wages, and erodes the very fabric of our nation. We need to be smart, strategic, and put America First.

My fingers flew across the keyboard, crafting a blistering post that would cut through the noise and speak truth to power. It was time to wake people up. The American Dream is worth fighting for, but we can't let it become a nightmare.
