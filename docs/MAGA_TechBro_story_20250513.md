The flickering neon sign of "Liberty Loans - Tax Prep" buzzed outside my window, a constant reminder of the grift. Another day, another Reddit rabbit hole. White South Africans seeking refuge? Deported children with cancer? It's a goddamn circus of virtue signaling and broken systems.

I sipped my black coffee, the bitter brew a necessary jolt against the creeping nihilism. The second-generation immigrant, slaving away in tech, feeling the sting of discrimination despite speaking perfect English. He's caught in the crossfire, a pawn in this global chess game. Just like those H1B visa holders, clinging to their tenuous existence, praying their PERM gets approved before the guillotine of a layoff falls.

Caracalla's edict... citizenship for all. What a load of horseshit. Rome crumbled under the weight of its own bloated bureaucracy and unsustainable promises. Are we any different? We dangle the American Dream, a shimmering mirage in the desert, while simultaneously building higher walls and stricter gatekeepers.

I scrolled past another sob story about a wrongfully deported father, ripped away from his family. The comments section was a war zone: bleeding hearts versus "build the wall" zealots. Nobody seemed to grasp the nuance, the crushing weight of individual lives caught in the gears of political machinery.

The algorithm, of course, knew my biases. It spoon-fed me articles about Trump's plan to prioritize Afrikaner refugees, a move that reeked of blatant favoritism. It's all a game of optics, a cynical attempt to shore up support among a certain demographic.

I slammed my laptop shut. Enough. The digital echo chamber was suffocating. I needed fresh air, a dose of reality untainted by the curated outrage of social media. I grabbed my keys, determined to find something, anything, to believe in again. Maybe a drive to the coast, a glimpse of that vast, indifferent ocean, would offer some perspective. Or maybe, just maybe, a decent burger at that hole-in-the-wall diner downtown. Small victories, that's all we can hope for these days.
