The scent of old paper and despair clung to the Reddit threads like a shroud. Each post, a flickering candle in the darkness of the immigration system, revealed a life hanging in the balance. A young woman, driving newfound friends to asylum hearings, burdened by their hopes and fears. A Ukrainian, seeking refuge and a future, clinging to the fragile thread of a business venture in a land of opportunity. A soul, lost in the labyrinthine corridors of USCIS, begging for a word, a sign, anything to pierce the fog of uncertainty.

These were not just stories; they were echoes of the biblical narrative of exile and longing for home. Like the Israelites yearning for Jerusalem, these modern-day sojourners sought a promised land, a place of safety and belonging. Yet, the path was fraught with peril, the promise often obscured by bureaucratic hurdles and the ever-present threat of deportation.

I read of families torn apart, of dreams deferred, of the agonizing wait for a decision that could alter the course of a life. The faces of the applicants and their families came to mind; each of them created in God's image. I thought of Christ's words, "I was a stranger, and you welcomed me." How could we, as a nation, reconcile our Christian values with a system that seemed so often to inflict pain and suffering?

The birthright citizenship debate raged, a tempest of fear and economic anxieties. Some argued for its dismantling, citing financial ruin. Yet, I saw in those arguments a chilling echo of the Old Testament's treatment of the "foreigner within your gates." Deuteronomy reminds us to love the foreigner, for we ourselves were once foreigners in Egypt.

I am reminded that we are all sojourners on this earth, our true citizenship lies in heaven. But until that day, we are called to love our neighbors, to extend compassion and grace, especially to those who are vulnerable and marginalized. The immigration system is broken, not because of the people seeking a better life, but because of our own brokenness, our fear of the "other," our failure to see the image of God in every human face. It is time for a reformation, a turning back to the principles of justice, mercy, and love that should guide our nation's policies.
