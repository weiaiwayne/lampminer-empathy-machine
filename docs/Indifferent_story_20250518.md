Okay, here's my take on things after doomscrolling through Reddit all day.

The notification pinged: "FTA0 created 3/28/2025." Cool, another string of meaningless letters and numbers. Like a new firmware update for my toaster oven, but instead of crispy bagels, it’s someone’s future, probably stuck in the NBC. National Benefits Center? Sounds about as exciting as watching paint dry.

I swiped it away, already onto the next thread: "Got married and being blacked mailed." Yikes. Ten years down the drain because someone's dad is stuck in the 1950s and now there's a green card involved. People are wild. Honestly, who still gets married because of *family pressure*? It's 2024, almost 2025. Get with the times, boomers.

Then there's the asylum interview. Imagine having your entire life boiling down to a single conversation, hoping some bureaucrat in a suit has empathy that day. "Came here at 25, now at 37, feels like my life went just a bad experiment..." Oof. That hits different. All those years, just hoping for a break.

Makes you think. About the constant churn. The H1Bs, the F1s, the U4Us. Everyone scrambling for a piece of the American dream, only to find out it's more of a multi-level marketing scheme. Promises of freedom and opportunity, but with fine print that could bury you.

And for what? So I can buy the latest iPhone and argue with strangers about the best graphics card? Ironic how I'm sitting here, judging everyone else’s struggles on my overpriced phone, while they're just trying to survive.

Maybe I should unplug for a bit. Go outside. Touch grass, as the kids say. But then I’d miss all the drama. And besides, there's a new meme template trending. Gotta stay informed, right? Maybe tomorrow I'll care. Maybe tomorrow I'll actually *do* something. But probably not.
