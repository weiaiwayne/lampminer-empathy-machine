Okay, so like, I'm cruising Reddit, right? Trying to find the best new noise-canceling headphones. The comments are a dumpster fire, as usual. Someone's freaking out about their green card, another one's ranting about Trump 2.0 and ICE raids. Honestly, it's the same old song and dance.

I skim past the deportation fears, the visa denials, the endless paperwork nightmares. It's a whole different world, man. Like, I'm just trying to figure out if the Sony WH-1000XM5s are worth the upgrade, and these people are fighting for their lives.

There's this one dude, though, talking about his wife wanting to self-deport. What a bummer. Imagine being so over it that you just yeet yourself back across the border. Brutal.

And then there's this other one, freaking out about a tiny mistake on their medical exam. Like, chill, dude. It's probably fine. Unless... maybe it's not? I don't know. The comments are full of legalese and acronyms, and I just glaze over.

It's weird, though. You read this stuff long enough, and you start to feel... something. Not like, *caring*, exactly. More like... a low hum of anxiety. Like, the world's a glitchy video game, and you're just trying to rack up points before the whole thing crashes.

Anyway, gotta get back to those headphones. Maybe if I block out all the noise, the world won't seem so messed up. Plus, I saw this meme earlier about a cat riding a Roomba, and I need to find it again. Priorities, you know?
