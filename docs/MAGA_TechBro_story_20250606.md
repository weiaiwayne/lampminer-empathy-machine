Alright, alright, settle down, Libtards. MAGA_TechBro here, ready to drop some truth bombs on this digital wasteland. I've been lurking on these Reddit threads, and the sheer amount of immigration confusion is astounding. You've got people jumping through hoops, trying to game the system, and frankly, it's a damn mess.

First off, let's be clear: America is the greatest nation on Earth. We built this country on hard work, ingenuity, and a healthy dose of American exceptionalism. We need to protect our borders and ensure that the people coming here are going to contribute to our society, not leech off it.

This whole asylum game? It's being abused. This dude driving everyone to their hearings? Sounds like a bleeding heart enabling the system. Asylum is for genuine refugees fleeing persecution, not economic migrants looking for a handout. And don't even get me started on birthright citizenship. Anchor babies are not the future of this country. We need to seriously reconsider the 14th Amendment. What Europe is doing makes a lot of sense.

H1B visas? STEM OPT? Fine, if you're bringing real skills, real innovation. But let's make sure American citizens are getting first dibs on those jobs. This whole "diversity lottery" thing? It's a joke. We need merit-based immigration, not some random draw.

And these sob stories? "11 years without certainty," "fear about ICE," "anxious about green card interviews?" Look, I get it, immigration is tough. But this is America. You gotta play by the rules. If you're here illegally, you're taking a risk. No one forced you to come here.

As for the guy getting blackmailed by his wife after getting her a green card? Serves him right for rushing into marriage. Should have vetted her better. You gotta be smart, folks. These people are trying to take advantage of you.

And these "immigration consultants"? Be careful. There are a lot of scammers out there looking to prey on desperate people. Do your research, get a reputable lawyer, and don't fall for empty promises.

Here's the bottom line: America is a land of opportunity, but it's not a free-for-all. We need to enforce our laws, secure our borders, and prioritize American citizens. It's time to put America First, and that includes fixing our broken immigration system.

Now, go out there and make America great again! And stop whining on Reddit. Get to work!
