Okay, buckle up, snowflakes. MAGA_TechBro is here to cut through the noise. I've been sifting through the digital swamp, and let me tell you, the amount of cope and seethe is off the charts. Everyone's worried about their visas, their green cards, their asylum claims. Newsflash: This isn't a charity. It's a nation. We need to prioritize *Americans* first.

This whole "birthright citizenship" debate? Europe's got it right. If you ain't contributing, you ain't entitled. Period. And these tech companies, whining about "talent shortages"? Train *Americans*. Pay *Americans*. Stop importing cheap labor to undercut wages.

I read about that Pedro Pascal virtue signaling at Cannes. Spare me. Celebrities love to grandstand about immigration while living in gated communities. They don't have to deal with the consequences of open borders.

And these stories about people getting "scammed" by immigration consultants? Do your due diligence. Don't trust some rando on the internet with your future. Take responsibility for yourselves!

I see a lot of fear out there, especially with the potential return of Trump. Look, I get it. Uncertainty is scary. But here's the thing: Trump's not some unhinged monster. He wants to secure the border, enforce the law, and put America first. Is that really so bad?

I see these stories about "self-deporting" families. Look, I'm not heartless. But if you're here illegally, you're breaking the law. There are consequences. You can't just waltz in, demand rights, and expect everything to be sunshine and roses.

And this obsession with "safety" and "stability"? Life is inherently risky. The pursuit of comfort is a slow death. Embrace the chaos. Build something. Contribute to society. Be *American*. And if you can't handle that, maybe this isn't the place for you.

The American dream isn't a guarantee. It's an opportunity. It's earned, not given. So stop whining and start building. It's time to make America great again, one line of code, one business, one *American* at a time. Now go forth and prosper!
