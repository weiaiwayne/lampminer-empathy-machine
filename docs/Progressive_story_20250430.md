The flickering screen illuminated my face, another Reddit thread fading into the endless scroll. Today's topic: a child, a US citizen, deported with cancer. NOLA ICE. The words stuck in my throat like bile.

I slammed my laptop shut, the sudden darkness punctuated by the red glow of my phone charging. The weight of it all settled on me, a familiar ache. Caracalla's edict, immigration law books, a Venezuelan man tackled in a courthouse, a green card holder in Pakistan wondering if they should move to the US immediately or wait for their degree - it was all a tangled mess.

A second-generation immigrant lamenting the toxic work culture in America, a young person in the National Guard trying to help their undocumented parents avoid deportation by enlisting, a wife forced into a safe house after DHS posted her address online - their stories echoed in my head like a chorus of quiet desperation.

The romanticized "American Dream" - a cruel joke for so many. It's clear the system is failing. It's not about hard work and pulling yourself up by your bootstraps, it's about luck and privilege, and a whole lot of systemic barriers designed to keep people down.

I thought of my own family, generations back, drawn here by the same false promises. Did they find what they were looking for? Did they face the same discrimination, the same bureaucratic nightmares?

I picked up my phone, my fingers hovering over the screen. Time to find a protest. A fundraiser. Something, anything, to push back against the rising tide of injustice. The world feels broken, but silence is complicity.

There is a young Greek woman looking to win the diversity visa lottery. I hope she gets it. I hope she finds refuge here, and a place where she can sleep well at night. I will do my best to advocate for her, and everyone who needs it, because that's the only way we can build a better world.
