The fluorescent lights of the courthouse hummed a discordant tune, a soundtrack to the anxiety radiating from Maria beside me. Monday. Asylum hearing. Her last chance. I squeezed her hand, the skin surprisingly cool despite the nervous sweat I could practically feel emanating from her pores. I’d seen this show before, different faces, same fear. The system, a bureaucratic behemoth, grinding down lives with its endless paperwork and arbitrary decisions.

I thought of little Mateo, back at my apartment, drawing superheroes with crayons. His future hung in the balance, not on his own merits or dreams, but on the whims of some judge interpreting laws written centuries ago, laws that somehow deemed him less worthy because of where he was born.

My mind drifted to the Reddit threads I'd been scrolling through late last night. A student, scholarship in hand, terrified of being denied a visa. Another soul, navigating the labyrinthine pathways of H1B and F-2 visas, desperate for stability. All these people, caught in the gears of a system that prioritizes paperwork over humanity.

And then the article about birthright citizenship in Europe. The chilling realization that even after a lifetime of contribution, of building a life, of raising families, people could still be denied full belonging. It felt like a warning, a glimpse into a future where the very idea of citizenship becomes a privilege, not a right.

The bailiff called Maria’s name. Her eyes widened, a flicker of terror in their depths. I stood with her, a silent promise of support. As she walked towards the courtroom doors, I couldn't shake the feeling that we were all on trial. Not just Maria, but the very ideals of justice and equality this country claimed to uphold. And I was tired of watching them crumble under the weight of indifference and outdated laws. It was time to fight back, to dismantle this system brick by brick, and build something better, something fairer, something that truly reflected the promise of liberty and justice for all.
