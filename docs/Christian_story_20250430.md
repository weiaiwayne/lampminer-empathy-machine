The flickering screen illuminates my face, a mosaic of Reddit threads painting a grim picture of the world. Immigration. A word that used to conjure images of Ellis Island and the American Dream, now feels like a barbed wire fence, electrified by political anxieties and bureaucratic indifference.

I see the echoes of Caracalla's edict, a historical precedent for open borders, yet the modern reality is far more complex. The second-generation American, caught in the grind of toxic work environments and casual discrimination, yearns for a fulfilling life, a life that seems increasingly unattainable. Is this the "better" life immigrants are supposed to be grateful for?

Then there's the ache of "migratory grief," a term that resonates with the deep sense of loss and displacement experienced by those torn from their roots. The young person, uprooted and replanted in a foreign land, now strangers in their own home. It reminds me of Adam and Eve, exiled from Eden, forever longing for a lost paradise.

I read of green card delays, H1B anxieties, and the constant fear of deportation hanging over families like the sword of Damocles. The pregnant women deported from the Dominican Republic, and the 4-year-old US citizen with cancer, deported from NOLA.

The story of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, wrongly deported, his wife forced into hiding after the government carelessly exposed her address, chills me to the bone. It's a stark reminder of the fragility of our earthly existence and the power of the state to inflict unimaginable suffering. Where is justice? Where is mercy?

Even those with legal status, professors on H1B visas, face limitations and anxieties. The O1 visa applicant, baffled by an RFE that seems to ignore the evidence presented, experiences the Kafkaesque absurdity of the immigration system. 

The world feels increasingly fractured, a landscape of broken promises and shattered dreams. But amidst the darkness, I see glimmers of hope. The kindness of strangers, the resilience of the human spirit, the unwavering faith that sustains us through trials.

I close my eyes and pray, not just for those caught in the web of immigration laws, but for a world where justice and mercy prevail, where all are welcomed and treated with the dignity they deserve. A world that truly reflects the love and grace of our Lord.
