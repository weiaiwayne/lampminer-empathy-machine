The hum of the server rack was a lullaby to me, a symphony of American ingenuity. Outside, the coastal elites probably clutched their pearls over the latest woke outrage. Inside, I was building the future.

The newsfeed scrolled past: "Tariffs on China Jump to 125%!" Good. Finally, someone's got the balls to stand up to those commies. Sure, some of these Reddit whiners are complaining about margins, but short-term pain for long-term gain, people! We need to bring manufacturing back to the USA, build a wall of steel around our economic sovereignty.

Ironic, though, isn't it? I built this whole dropshipping side hustle on cheap Chinese goods. Custom planners, mostly. Millennial pink crap for basic b*tches who think "manifesting" is a substitute for hard work. Profitable, though. And it funds my real passion: building decentralized, censorship-resistant platforms.

Speaking of planners, some poor sap on Reddit is whining about SEO. Probably another soy boy who thinks Google is his friend. Newsflash: Google is a weaponized propaganda machine. That "SEO service" he's looking at? Probably just another way for them to track and control him.

This is why I'm building my own search engine. One that values truth, not clicks. One that promotes American values, not globalist agendas. It's a long shot, I know. The tech giants have a stranglehold on the internet. But Trump didn't win by playing by their rules. He bulldozed right through them.

I take a swig of my black coffee, the caffeine coursing through my veins. The future isn't going to build itself. We need to be smart, agile, and ruthless. Split shipments, transship through Vietnam, whatever it takes to survive this transition. But more importantly, we need to build our own infrastructure, our own platforms, our own economy.

We need to Make America Great Again, one line of code at a time. And if that means paying a 125% tariff on some Chinese trinkets, so be it. Freedom isn't free, after all.
