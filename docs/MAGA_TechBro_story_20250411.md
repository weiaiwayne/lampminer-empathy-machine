The hum of the server farm was my lullaby. Another late night, optimizing algorithms, chasing the bleeding edge of AI. But tonight, the usual thrill was muted. Reddit had burrowed under my skin.

That kid, the one who slipped across the border as a child, haunted me. "Waiting for asylum approval," he said. Waiting. In this country, waiting is a luxury many can't afford. We built this nation on opportunity, on pulling yourself up by your bootstraps, but the system is rigged. Bureaucracy chokes the American dream before it even takes its first breath. We need secure borders, yes, but also a streamlined, *fair* immigration process. Legal immigration. That's the key.

Then there was the airport hotel story. UK mercenaries? ICE raids coordinated from airport lounges? It sounded like a fever dream, the kind fueled by too much conspiracy theory and not enough sleep. Yet, the seed of doubt was planted. The government needs to protect its citizens, but not at the cost of liberty. We can't become a police state in the name of security. That's not the America I believe in. That's not American exceptionalism.

And the kid with the traffic ticket? Another victim of a system designed to extract revenue, not ensure justice. A first offense, a phone barely touched, and now he's facing points on his license, a permanent mark on his record. It's highway robbery, plain and simple.

We need to fight back against the overreach, against the red tape, against the forces that are eroding the very foundation of this nation. We need to return to our founding principles: individual liberty, limited government, and a free market that rewards hard work and innovation.

I took a long pull from my lukewarm coffee, the caffeine doing little to dispel the unease. Back to the code. Back to building a better future, one line at a time. But tonight, the code felt different. It felt like a prayer, a desperate plea for a return to the America I know is possible. An America of opportunity, freedom, and justice for all, not just a select few. An America where a kid with a dream, no matter where he came from, has a fair shot.
