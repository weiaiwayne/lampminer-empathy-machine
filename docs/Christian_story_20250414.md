The scent of cardamom and dust hung heavy in the air, a phantom limb of a memory. I scrolled through the Reddit thread, the glowing screen reflecting in my weary eyes. Another story of “cultural bereavement,” another soul adrift in the sea of the unfamiliar. It resonated, a dull ache in my own heart, though my story was different.

My ancestors, they crossed oceans for a promise, a whisper of freedom etched on the Statue of Liberty. They sought a new Zion, a land flowing with milk and honey. And some found it, no doubt. Built their homes, raised their families, clinging to faith like a lifeline. But at what cost?

I thought of the second-generation American, caught between two worlds, the inherited dreams of his parents clashing with the harsh realities of a society that still saw him as "other." He sought stability, a secure place in the marketplace, but found only the grinding gears of a system that valued profit over people. The Scriptures warned against chasing after earthly treasures, but how could one build a life, a family, in a world obsessed with material gain?

The story of Caracalla echoed in my mind. Citizenship for all! A grand gesture, perhaps, but did it truly foster unity? Or did it merely dilute the existing culture, creating a superficial cohesion that masked deeper divisions? I feared that modern immigration policies, however well-intentioned, might suffer a similar fate.

Lord, give us wisdom. Not just to open our borders, but to open our hearts. To welcome the stranger, not just as a worker or a taxpayer, but as a child of God, deserving of dignity and respect. To build bridges, not walls. To seek true reconciliation, rooted in justice and love.

I closed my eyes, picturing the faces of the immigrants I knew – the weary doctor from Nigeria, the hardworking farmer from Mexico, the brilliant student from China. Each one, a unique tapestry woven into the fabric of this nation. And yet, so many felt lost, unseen, unheard.

My prayer was simple: that we might learn to see each other, not as problems to be solved, but as fellow pilgrims on this earthly journey, seeking a home that transcends borders and ideologies, a home in the heart of God. Only then, I believed, could we truly build a nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
