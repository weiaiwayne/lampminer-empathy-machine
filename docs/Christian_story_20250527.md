The flickering screen illuminated my worn Bible, a stark contrast to the chaotic threads of Reddit I'd been sifting through. Lord, it's a tangled web. These souls, yearning for stability, for a place to call home, their stories echo the ancient longing for the promised land.

Maria, in Ukraine, separated from her spouse, clinging to the hope of a green card through a subsidiary. Her entrepreneurial spirit, a flame against the darkness. I pray she finds favor, that her passion bears fruit, and that she and her husband are reunited.

Then there's the Afghan national, adrift in Turkey, soon to embark on a solitary journey to America. Fear gnaws at me for him, the fear of scrutiny, the judgment cast upon him because of his origin. Lord, grant him safe passage, a welcoming embrace, and shield him from prejudice. Let him find kindness and understanding.

And the DACA recipient, facing an interview after years of marriage and children. A life built on uncertain ground. I ask for wisdom for the interviewer, that they see beyond the paperwork, to the heart of this family, to the contributions this individual has made to this nation.

The stories of birthright citizenship debates, of families torn apart by deportation, they weigh heavy on my soul. We are called to be a beacon of hope, a refuge for the weary.

I close my eyes, the words of Hebrews resonating: "Remember those in prison as if you were their fellow prisoners, and those who are mistreated as if you yourselves were suffering."

Lord, I pray for discernment, to see the world through Your eyes, to offer a hand, a prayer, a word of encouragement to those who seek refuge and a better life. Help me to be a vessel of Your love, a reflection of Your grace, in this broken world.
