The hum of the Charlotte Douglas International Airport pressed against my ears, a discordant symphony of anxieties. Someone had asked about landing there, and the question resonated, a tiny pinprick in the balloon of my carefully constructed faith. Landing. Arrival. But at what cost?

The world felt precarious, a house built on sand. The news, gleaned from hurried glances at Reddit during my morning devotions, painted a grim picture. Families torn apart, the vulnerable exploited, and the powerful drunk on their own perceived righteousness. It was Caracalla's Rome all over again, citizenship weaponized, anxieties exploited. Even the second-generation immigrant, born on American soil, felt the sting of discrimination, the endless grind of a system that promised much but delivered unevenly.

My heart ached for my Cuban sister in Christ, haunted by the specter of deportation despite decades of faithful citizenship. The fear was a virus, spreading through communities, whispering doubts about belonging, about safety. And the stories! Children deported, families shattered, a world where even a horse could become a pawn in a border dispute. Was there no room for grace? For mercy?

Yet, amidst the chaos, a flicker of hope remained. The stories of resilience, of communities rallying, of individuals fighting for justice, reminded me that even in the darkest times, the light of Christ could pierce through. The reminder to know your rights, the desperate search for pro bono lawyers, the shared experiences of grief and loss â€“ these were all testaments to the enduring human spirit, a reflection of God's image even in brokenness.

I clutched my worn Bible, the Psalms a balm to my soul. "God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble." (Psalm 46:1). It was a promise, a lifeline in the swirling currents of fear and uncertainty. My task, as a Christian, was not to succumb to despair, but to be a beacon of hope, to offer a hand to the vulnerable, to advocate for justice, and to pray for a world where compassion triumphed over cruelty. To truly land and thrive.
