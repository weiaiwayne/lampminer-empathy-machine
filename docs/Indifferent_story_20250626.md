Okay, so, like, immigration stuff is a *mess*, right? I've been scrolling through Reddit – which, let's be real, is basically my news source these days – and it's a non-stop rollercoaster of anxiety and paperwork. People are stressing about visas, green cards, interviews, *everything*. It's kinda wild.

I saw this post about a dude who got married and his wife is trying to blackmail him about the green card. Seriously?! Like, relationship goals: *not*. And then there's all the ICE stuff. People are actually scared to leave their houses. It makes me wanna roll my eyes into another dimension.

Anyway, I saw this thing about some Tiktoker being detained by ICE. Kinda makes you wonder what's up and if they're trying to set an example of how tough they are.

Honestly, it's just kinda sad. People are working their butts off, trying to build lives, and then BAM, paperwork nightmare or the threat of deportation. I'm just trying to keep up with the latest phone releases and meme trends, but then I see all this and it's like, "Woah, reality check."

I saw someone mention they were tired of living in the US and wanted to move to Canada, I get it.

Meanwhile, I'm over here wondering if my new noise-canceling headphones will actually block out the sound of my neighbor's dog barking at 3 AM. Priorities, right? But seriously, good luck to all those folks navigating the immigration maze. You're gonna need it. I'll just stick to my memes. Maybe I'll find a relevant one to share later.
