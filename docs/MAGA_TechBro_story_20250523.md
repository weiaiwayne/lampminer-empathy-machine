The hum of the server room was a constant, a low thrum of digital life support for the American Dream, or what it had become. I adjusted my MAGA hat, the red a stark contrast to the sterile gray. The Reddit threads swam in my head – asylum seekers, H1B hopefuls, green card anxieties. Each post a tiny digital cry for help in a system increasingly indifferent, if not outright hostile.

This morning, I was thinking about the guy whose I-485 got approved, but then the system glitched on his biometrics, and his file was transferred to Cincinnati. Cincinnati! Bureaucratic purgatory. And the Afghan national flying solo, armed with his CR1 visa and a prayer. Or the Kenyan researcher, struggling to categorize his purpose for travel. 

I thought about my grandfather, who came here with nothing but grit and a desire to build something. Now, it feels like the country's slamming the door on anyone who isn't already inside, even if they just want to build something.

I stepped outside, the Texas sun a brutal reminder of reality. I fired up my Tesla, autopilot engaged, and scrolled through Breitbart. Pedro Pascal, virtue signaling at Cannes about immigration. Celebrities, always so eager to virtue signal from their mansions. They don't get it. They don't see the strain on the system, the erosion of our culture.

But then, I thought about the guy in New York who got a speeding ticket. He was on a STEM OPT, H1B picked. One wrong move, one slip-up, and it could all come crashing down.  He was just trying to make a life, contribute.

Maybe the system isn't inherently evil, just…broken.  Maybe it needs a good hard reset, a dose of Trump-era common sense. Secure the border, yes, but also reward those who play by the rules, who want to be part of building a stronger, more prosperous America.  It's a tough balance, a constant struggle. I just hope we get it right before the whole damn server crashes.
