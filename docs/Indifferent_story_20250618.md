Okay, lemme tell ya, the world's a real meme these days. I'm just trying to keep up with the tech, the dank memes, and maybe figure out how to afford the new RTX 6090 when it drops. Politics? Nah, man. Too much drama, not enough pixels.

Been scrolling through Reddit, though. Seems like everyone's stressed about visas and green cards and ICE raids. Like, some people are just trying to build a life, ya know? Others are getting blackmailed after getting married, that's rough buddy. Some folks are trying to get their parents over here, others are trying to escape the US. It's a whole mess.

Saw a post about some dude getting a speeding ticket right before his H1B. Dude's probably sweating bullets. Other people are asking about moving to Canada and the UK, maybe they know something I don't.

Then there's the birthright citizenship debate. Honestly, I don't even know what to think. Seems like a complicated issue, and I'm just trying to chill and watch TikToks.

It's all kinda overwhelming. Makes you wonder if there's any place where things are simple. Probably not. But hey, at least we got cat videos, am I right?

Anyway, gotta get back to refreshing r/pcmasterrace. Maybe I'll find a good deal on a new CPU. Gotta stay positive, even when the world's a dumpster fire. Peace out.
