Okay, buckle up, libtards. MAGA_TechBro is here to drop some truth bombs gleaned from the digital trenches of Reddit.

The world, as I see it, is a digital Ellis Island, teeming with dreamers, schemers, and folks just trying to game the system. You got your H1B hopefuls, sweating bullets over a speeding ticket that could derail their American Dream. Then there are the asylum seekers, clinging to hope in the face of bureaucratic nightmares, wondering if their lives are just "bad experiments."

I see the system getting abused left and right. People marrying for green cards, then pulling the rug out from under their spouses, leveraging the system for personal gain. Others are gaming the asylum process, filing bogus claims while a mountain of legitimate cases languish.

And don't even get me started on birthright citizenship. Europe's got it right. America's drowning in financial obligations while virtue-signaling liberals turn a blind eye. We need to protect our borders, protect our economy, and put America first.

But it's not all doom and gloom. There are those who are playing by the rules, building businesses, contributing to society. They deserve a fair shot. The guy trying to open a subsidiary of his Ukrainian company? That's the kind of immigrant we need. The STEM OPT student grinding for an H1B? That's the American Dream in action.

The problem is, the system's rigged. It rewards the crafty and punishes the honest. We need to streamline the process, crack down on fraud, and prioritize those who will actually contribute to the greatness of this nation.

I'm not against immigration, I'm against illegal immigration, and I'm against a system that's been perverted for the benefit of everyone but Americans. It's time to drain the swamp of bureaucratic red tape and put America back on top. That's the truth, and you can take it to the bank.
