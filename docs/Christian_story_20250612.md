The chipped mug warmed my hands as I scrolled through the endless stream of anxieties. Reddit, my digital town square, was buzzing with familiar fears: deportation, denied visas, the ever-present threat of ICE. Lord, have mercy.

It's hard to reconcile these anxieties with the promises of Scripture, the assurance of refuge in Him. Yet, I see the faces in these posts—the Afghan husband arriving alone, the DACA recipient facing an interview, the mother terrified for her brown-skinned child—and I know their fear is real. Their anxieties are valid.

I believe God calls us to love our neighbors, and right now, my neighbors are these digital strangers, wrestling with a system that seems designed to break them. It's easy to fall into the trap of nationalistic pride, to parrot the arguments of those who see immigrants as a threat. But where is the compassion in that? Where is the reflection of Christ?

The story of Ruth, a Moabite widow, echoes in my mind. She chose to stay with Naomi, embracing a foreign land and a foreign God. She was an outsider, yet she found grace and became part of the lineage of Christ. Shouldn't we strive to create a society where such grace is extended to all?

I see the desperation in the posts about marriage-based green cards gone wrong, the fear of abuse and blackmail. Marriage, a sacred covenant, twisted into a tool for immigration. It breaks my heart. I pray for discernment for those wrestling with such difficult choices, for strength to resist evil, and for the courage to seek justice.

The young student on a Stem OPT, worried about a speeding ticket, reminds me of the fragility of their dreams. A minor mistake, a moment of carelessness, could jeopardize everything. Lord, grant them wisdom and favor.

I don't have easy answers. I don't know how to fix the broken immigration system. But I can offer prayer, empathy, and a commitment to seeking truth and justice. I can remember that every face on Reddit represents a soul created in God's image, deserving of dignity and respect. That is a start. That is where my faith calls me. And that must be enough, for now.
