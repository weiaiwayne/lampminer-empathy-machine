The flickering screen illuminated my worn study Bible as I scrolled through another thread on Reddit. The digital world, a cacophony of anxieties and hopes, mirrored the anxieties and hopes of my own heart. The stories blurred together: visa denials, deportation fears, dreams deferred, and families fractured. It was a digital lament echoing the ancient cries for justice and mercy.

One post, in particular, snagged my attention: a woman, manipulated and abused by her own mother, now facing the deportation of her father due to a false accusation. The mother, an undocumented immigrant herself, weaponized the system she feared. It was a grotesque distortion of justice, a perversion of the very principles of refuge and compassion.

My heart ached. This wasn't just about immigration; it was about the unraveling of families, the corrosive power of bitterness, and the failure of love. I closed my eyes, the weight of these stories pressing down. How could I reconcile this modern-day chaos with the steadfast love and justice of God?

The answer, as always, lay in the Word. I opened my Bible to Micah 6:8: "He has shown you, O mortal, what is good. And what does the Lord require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God."

Justice. Mercy. Humility. These were the cornerstones of a godly response. Justice demanded that I advocate for the wrongly accused, for families torn apart by fear and prejudice. Mercy compelled me to extend compassion, even to those who seemed undeserving, remembering that we are all flawed and in need of grace. And humility reminded me that I, too, am a stranger in this world, seeking a home in the Kingdom of God.

The Reddit threads, the anxieties, the injustices â€“ they were all a call to action. Not to despair, but to engage. To use my voice, my resources, and my faith to reflect the love and justice of Christ in a broken world. It wouldn't be easy, but I knew I wasn't alone. The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob was with me, guiding me, and empowering me to be a beacon of hope in the digital wilderness. And that was a promise worth clinging to.
