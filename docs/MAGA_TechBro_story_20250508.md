The chipped Formica table in the internet cafe glowed under the harsh fluorescent lights, mirroring the anxiety simmering in Anya’s gut. Another tab open, another forum scrolled, another whispered prayer to a god she wasn’t sure existed anymore. Her fingers, stained with cheap coffee and the ink of countless applications, danced across the keyboard. The USCIS website blinked mockingly.

Her mother, a ghost of Cuba clinging to a fifty-year-old citizenship, haunted her dreams. The fear, a virus ingested through social media, had metastasized into a palpable dread. Anya felt it too, a second-generation echo, a phantom limb of displacement.

Across the digital ether, stories flickered like dying embers. A Venezuelan man tackled in a courthouse, the casual brutality captured in a CNN link. A desperate plea for help from someone whose father, a mechanic with a cross tattoo, faced the abyss of Cecot. A green card holder in Pakistan, paralyzed by the rising tide of anti-immigrant sentiment.

Anya clicked on a thread about a family separated at the border. The comments section, a festering wound of hate and fear, made her stomach churn. She closed the tab, the vitriol leaving a metallic taste in her mouth.

She glanced at the faded photograph taped to the edge of the monitor. Her grandmother, young and defiant, standing in front of the Statue of Liberty. The promise of America, once so bright, now seemed a cruel joke.

A new email popped up. “I-130 Approved.” Relief washed over her, a fleeting wave in a storm-tossed sea. But the joy was immediately tempered by the reality she had just been reading about. Would her husband be approved? Would they even see the new evidence in the new case? Even if approved, would the constant pressure of legal limbo, the gnawing anxiety, eventually erode their love, their sanity?

Anya closed her laptop, the screen reflecting her own weary face. The world felt fractured, a landscape of broken promises and arbitrary borders. All she could do was keep fighting, keep hoping, keep believing that somewhere, somehow, a safe harbor still existed. She stood up, the chair scraping against the floor, and walked out into the night, a single, fragile candle flickering in the gathering darkness.
