The flickering screen, a portal to a thousand anxieties, illuminates my face in the dimness of the study. The scent of old leather from my grandfather's Bible mingles with the stale air of unanswered prayers. Immigration, a tapestry woven with hope and fear, scrolls endlessly before me. Caracalla's decree, a ghost of ancient Rome, whispers of unity and disruption, a mirror to our modern struggles.

A young Salvadorian boy's fear for his father claws at my heart. The cross, a symbol of salvation, now a potential mark of damnation in a world where borders harden and compassion wanes. Cecot, a name that chills the blood, a modern-day Gehenna where the vulnerable are cast. I think of the Good Samaritan, and how far we have strayed from his example.

Then there's the second-generation American, a child of immigrants, yearning for a life beyond the relentless grind, a life where work doesn't devour the soul. The promise of the American Dream, once a beacon, now a flickering bulb in a toxic workplace. The scriptures warn against chasing earthly treasures, yet how can we deny the basic human desire for dignity and security?

Even the joyful expectation of a new life is tinged with anxiety. A mother, desperate to bring her child into the world on American soil, seeks a humanitarian visa for her husband. The family, the cornerstone of society, fractured by bureaucratic walls and political tides.

The weight of these unseen faces settles upon me. Each post, a fragment of a life, a testament to the brokenness of our world. I close my eyes, seeking solace in the Psalms. "God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble." But refuge feels distant, and strength falters in the face of such overwhelming need.

I pray for discernment, for wisdom to see through the fog of fear and prejudice. I pray for a renewed spirit of compassion, a return to the values that Christ preached: love, mercy, and justice for all, regardless of their origin or circumstance. The screen glows again, beckoning me back to the digital sea of human stories. The work is endless, but the call to love our neighbor remains.
