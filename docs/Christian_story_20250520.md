The flickering screen cast a pale light on my worn Bible. I closed it, the scent of old paper and truth a comforting anchor in the swirling currents of the digital sea I’d been navigating. Reddit. A strange mission field, teeming with anxieties and hopes, all filtered through the lens of immigration.

Young people, bright minds, yearning for a future, a place to belong. The Canadian, craving connection in Texas, a siren song of friendship across borders. The Afghan husband, venturing alone, carrying the weight of his nationality in a world quick to judge. The Ukrainian, clinging to the U4U status, dreaming of reuniting his family, perhaps through the hard work of entrepreneurship. The betrayed husband, trapped in a nightmare of blackmail, a twisted mockery of the sacred covenant of marriage.

My heart aches for them. The scriptures tell us to welcome the stranger, to love our neighbor as ourselves. But the world, even in these digital spaces, often reflects a different story. Fear, suspicion, and the cold machinery of bureaucracy grind against the human spirit.

I think of that man, the aircraft mechanic, pouring his heart out into the digital void, 11 years in limbo. "God is good," he wrote, yet the question hung heavy: "But sometime I don't understand his plan for humanity!"

I don't either, brother. Not always. But I cling to the promise that God works all things together for good for those who love Him. And I pray, I pray for these souls, caught in the complexities of a broken world. I pray for wisdom for those advising them, that they might offer godly counsel, not just legal strategies. I pray for mercy from those in authority, that they might see the individual stories behind the forms and the regulations.

Perhaps, in some small way, by offering a listening ear, a word of encouragement, a prayer lifted up, I can be a vessel of God’s grace in this strange, digital land. The task seems daunting, but I am reminded of the parable of the mustard seed, small but full of potential. The Kingdom of God, like a welcoming hand, can take root even in the most unlikely of places. And perhaps, just perhaps, a little bit of hope can bloom amidst the anxieties and fears of Reddit.
