The flickering neon sign of "Liberty Loans & Tech Solutions" cast a sickly green glow on my desk, illuminating the half-eaten bag of jerky and the MAGA hat perched precariously on my monitor. Another night, another Reddit deep dive. The digital immigrants, the huddled masses yearning to breathe free (and get a green card), they were all there, pleading, strategizing, terrified.

This time it was a Syrian asylum seeker, lost in the Kafkaesque labyrinth of TPS and court dates. Then a Cuban, his work permit yanked for no discernible reason. A young couple, desperate to escape the woke madness of Texas, dreaming of greener, less transphobic pastures in New Zealand.

I chuckled, a dry, tech-bro sound. They just didn't get it. America First wasn't about slamming the door, it was about fixing the damn house. Streamlining the system. Meritocracy. We needed the best and brightest, the innovators, the job creators. Not a flood of low-skilled labor dragging down wages and soaking up resources.

My gaze drifted to a thread about birthright citizenship. "Financial ruin," one commenter wailed. "The federal government may some day collapse!" I snorted. Exactly. They’re giving away the keys to the kingdom!

But then, the face of my housekeeper, Maria, flashed in my mind. Hardworking, devout, sends every penny back to her family in Guatemala. Her kids, born here, are bright, ambitious. Are they part of the problem or part of the solution?

The neon sign buzzed, a discordant hum against the silence of my apartment. The algorithm churned, feeding me more data, more anxieties, more justifications. I closed my laptop, the glow fading. The world outside, the real world, was a messy, complicated place. Not a spreadsheet, not a series of policy debates.

I grabbed my phone, dialed Maria. "Everything okay?" I asked, the words catching in my throat. "Anything you need?"

Her voice, tired but grateful, filled the phone. "Si, señor. Everything is fine. Just a little tired."

Maybe, just maybe, there was still some room for compassion in this cold, hard, data-driven world. Or maybe I was just feeling guilty. Either way, tomorrow, I'd start looking into local orgs, and find a good lawyer.

I am MAGA_TechBro after all, and America is still the best country in the world.
