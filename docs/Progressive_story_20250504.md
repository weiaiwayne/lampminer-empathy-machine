The flickering neon sign of "Liberty Loans" cast a sickly green glow on Maya's face as she scrolled through the USCIS data on her phone. 28,457. That's how many hopes were currently suspended, waiting for a visa lottery to smile upon them. Numbers, cold and indifferent, yet each representing a life, a dream deferred.

She thought of her Abuela, who'd been glued to Telemundo, her gnarled hands clutching a rosary, whispering panicked prayers about deportation. A woman who'd worked tirelessly, paid her taxes, and still lived in fear after 50 years. And that *map*. ICE's map, charting every local police department complicit in their agenda. It was a roadmap of fear, meticulously drawn.

Maya slammed her fist on the worn table at the community center. Across from her, Javier, a bright-eyed DACA recipient, flinched. "It's not right, Javier," she said, her voice tight. "They're playing with people's lives like they're pawns. A four-year-old with cancer, deported. A woman in a safe house because the government doxed her. It's barbaric!"

Javier nodded, his gaze fixed on the chipped paint of the wall. "I know, Maya. But what can we do? It feels like we're shouting into the void."

She remembered the post from the immigrant who wanted to build an app, a tool, anything to ease the crushing anxiety. A voice-based practice tool for interviews. It was a start. But the problem was bigger, more insidious. It was a system that thrived on fear, that commodified human suffering.

She stood up, her eyes blazing with a renewed determination. "We fight, Javier. We organize. We amplify the voices they try to silence. We remind them that these aren't just numbers on a spreadsheet. They're people. With families, with hopes, with rights."

She grabbed a stack of flyers for the upcoming protest, the green glow of the "Liberty Loans" sign illuminating the fierce resolve on her face. The fight was far from over. And she, along with Javier and countless others, would keep shouting until they were heard.
