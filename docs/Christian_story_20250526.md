The flickering screen of my laptop illuminates my small study, casting dancing shadows on the framed verses hanging on the wall. Romans 13:1, "Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established," sits beside a print of a Reformation-era woodcut, a reminder of the ongoing struggle for truth and righteousness. I close the Reddit tab, the anxieties of strangers echoing in my mind. Asylum seekers, visa applicants, families separated by borders â€“ their stories, though filtered through the digital lens, are real, their struggles a reflection of the brokenness of this world.

I sigh, the weight of it all settling heavy on my shoulders. The promise of the American Dream, once a beacon of hope, seems tarnished, obscured by bureaucratic red tape and political maneuvering. The stories I read speak of desperate attempts to navigate the system, of families fractured, of dreams deferred. Even here, in this nation founded on ideals of liberty and justice for all, the reality is often far more complicated, far more painful.

My heart aches for the Afghan man traveling alone, his English halting, his future uncertain. I pray for the Ukrainian family, torn apart by war, seeking refuge on foreign soil. I think of the couple, one a US citizen, facing the agonizing choice of self-deportation, driven by fear and the promise of family.

The Reformed tradition teaches that God is sovereign, even in the midst of chaos. That He works all things according to the purpose of his will, even when we cannot see His hand. But this doesn't excuse us from action. We are called to be salt and light, to advocate for the vulnerable, to speak truth to power. As Christians, we are called to love our neighbors as ourselves, regardless of their nationality or immigration status.

I open my Bible to Matthew 25:35, "For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me." These words, spoken by Christ himself, are a constant challenge, a reminder that our faith demands more than just lip service. It demands action, compassion, and a willingness to stand alongside those who are suffering.

I close my eyes, offering a prayer for guidance, for strength, for the courage to live out my faith in a world that desperately needs the light of Christ. The digital world fades, replaced by the quiet certainty that, even in the face of injustice and uncertainty, God is good. His plan is unfolding, and we are called to be a part of it.
