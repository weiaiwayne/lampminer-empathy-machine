Rain splattered against the cracked window of my tiny apartment, the same rhythm as the memes scrolling through my phone. Another politician saying something dumb, another celebrity divorce, another algorithm-driven outrage. Yawn. I swiped, looking for something, anything, to break the monotony.

Reddit was a mixed bag as usual. Some poor schmuck's green card stuck in limbo, another terrified immigrant facing deportation. It’s always the same story, over and over. I don't know, I just got my own life to live. I am not in the position to solve immigration problems. I don't even know who to vote for.

Pedro Pascal, though. He gets it. I saw a clip of him talking about deportation. Good for him, using his platform. But what can one guy really do? The whole system's rigged, probably.

I paused on a post about birthright citizenship. Some dude on a non-immigrant visa arguing it should be dismantled to save the economy. Bold take. I mean, maybe he's got a point about the financial strain. But then what? You create a whole underclass, people born here but not really *belonging*? Sounds like a dystopian novel.

I scrolled on, landing on a thread about someone moving to Texas from Canada. Texas? No way. Too hot, too… loud. Give me Ontario any day. Still, I get the desire to change things. My own life felt like a rerun.

Suddenly, a notification popped up: "New RTX 5090 Ti leaked specs!" Yes! Now *that's* something to get excited about. Forget politics, forget immigration, forget the existential dread. New graphics card, baby! Time to build a new rig, crank up the settings, and escape into a virtual world where the only borders are the edges of the screen. Maybe that's the answer. Just build a better world, one polygon at a time.
