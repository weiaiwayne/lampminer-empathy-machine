The flickering screen illuminated Marco's face, a mask of exhaustion and simmering rage. He scrolled through Reddit, the digital tendrils of outrage and despair clinging to him. The story of the wrongly deported father-in-law, the manipulative mother-in-law – it was a twisted microcosm of the immigration system, a system he both championed and questioned.

He remembered Caracalla's edict – citizenship for all, a unifying act. But unity at what cost? Did it dilute the strength, the *exceptionalism* of Rome? He saw parallels in the current debates. Open borders, yes, but what about the cultural fabric, the shared values that held a nation together? He thought of the second-generation American, caught between two worlds, grinding in a toxic work environment. Was *this* the American Dream?

Marco slammed his fist on the desk. The horse, deported back across the Rio Grande – a symbol of the absurdity, the dehumanization inherent in border policies. He knew the arguments, the economic anxieties, the security concerns. But then he saw the face of the four-year-old, deported with cancer, and felt a cold knot in his stomach.

He, a tech bro, a libertarian, a believer in meritocracy, struggled to reconcile his ideals with the messy reality he witnessed online. He believed in the power of innovation, the freedom to build, to create. But what did any of it matter if the foundation, the very notion of justice and fairness, was crumbling?

He sighed, the weight of a million anxieties pressing down. He knew the answer wasn't a simple algorithm, a clever code fix. It required something more profound, something human: empathy, understanding, a willingness to see the world through the eyes of the other. He closed his laptop, the screen fading to black. The fight, he realized, wasn't just about borders and policies; it was about the soul of a nation. He would build his app, his company, and he would do it with a renewed sense of purpose, a commitment to building a better, more just America, even if the path was fraught with contradictions and uncertainty. He would start, though, by making a donation to the family of the wrongly deported father-in-law. It was a small act, but it was a start.
