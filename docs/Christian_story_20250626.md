The humid Texas air hung heavy, even through the screen door. I sipped lukewarm coffee, the Reddit threads blurring before my eyes. So much striving, so much hope intertwined with fear. A young Afghan man, a CR1 visa clutched in his hand, venturing into a country painted with both promise and potential prejudice. Lord, guide his steps, I prayed.

My heart ached for the DACA recipient, facing deportation after a lifetime spent here. Eleven years of uncertainty, a life built on shifting sands. "God is good, but sometime I don't understand his plan for humanity!" the post lamented. I wrestled with that sentiment often, the tension between divine sovereignty and human suffering a constant companion.

Then, the stark reality of birthright citizenship debates. My own ancestors, escaping persecution, found refuge in this very amendment. Yet, I couldn't ignore the anxieties, the economic anxieties fueling the desire to restrict it. Where is the balance, Lord? How do we reconcile compassion with prudence?

The threads wound together: H1B visas, student visas, asylum claims, marriage-based petitions, each a thread in the complex tapestry of human migration. I saw the desperation, the yearning for safety, for opportunity, for a better life for their children.

But I also saw the shadows: the coyote holding a family's home deed hostage, the abusive ex-husband exploiting the system, the lawyer ghosting vulnerable clients. Sin twists and corrupts everything, even the pursuit of a better life.

I closed my laptop, the glow reflecting in my weary eyes. The world felt heavy, burdened by broken systems and human fallibility. But then I remembered the boy in my church, the one with the pending DACA application. His bright smile, his unwavering faith â€“ a testament to resilience.

Perhaps, I thought, God's plan isn't always clear, but His love is. And maybe, just maybe, that love can be a beacon in the darkness, guiding us towards a more just and compassionate world. My place is to pray, to act justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with my God and to assist where I can.
