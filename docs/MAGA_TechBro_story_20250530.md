The flickering neon sign of the "Double D Diner" cast a sickly green glow across Maria's worn face. She clutched a steaming mug of coffee, the lukewarm liquid doing little to thaw the anxiety that had settled deep in her bones. Tonight, she was driving Miguel to his final asylum hearing. A US-born citizen, she was the designated chauffeur and moral support for half the staff at the tech company where she worked. A tech company that, ironically, relied on the talent of people fighting tooth and nail to stay in the land of opportunity.

Miguel, a brilliant programmer from Venezuela, was quiet, his eyes fixed on the rain-streaked window. He’d been through hell – political persecution, threats to his family. Maria, a staunch believer in American exceptionalism, found herself increasingly disillusioned by the bureaucratic labyrinth that stood between good people and a safe life.

She thought of the Reddit threads she’d been scrolling through late at night. H1B visas, F1 students with full scholarships denied for “immigrant intent,” the agonizing wait times for green cards. The stories were a constant reminder of the human cost hidden behind the legal jargon.

“Don’t worry, Miguel,” she said, forcing a smile. “Everything will be alright.”

He offered a weak smile in return, but she saw the fear in his eyes. The fear of a system that seemed designed to break people, to grind them down with endless paperwork and arbitrary decisions.

As she drove through the city, the glittering skyscrapers felt less like symbols of progress and more like monuments to a broken promise. She thought of the birthright citizenship debate raging online, the calls to dismantle the 14th Amendment. It was a betrayal of the very ideals that had drawn her ancestors to this country in the first place.

She gripped the steering wheel tighter, a surge of anger coursing through her. She was a tech bro, sure, but she was also an American. And she believed in something better than this. She believed in a country that welcomed the tired, the poor, the huddled masses yearning to breathe free. She just hoped Miguel’s hearing wouldn’t prove her wrong.
