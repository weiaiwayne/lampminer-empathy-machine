The flickering screen illuminated my face, another Reddit thread fading into the digital ether. Khaby Lame, the TikTok king, detained by ICE. Another data point in the sprawling landscape of injustice. I slammed my laptop shut, the sudden darkness a welcome reprieve.

My phone buzzed. A text from Maria, one of the folks I drive to their asylum hearings. "Final hearing Monday. Pray for me." Pray? I scoffed. Prayers felt useless against the bureaucratic machinery that grinds people like Maria into dust. Still, I texted back, "I'll be there. We'll fight."

The fight. It was all I knew. I was born here, a privilege I never asked for, a shield against the storm that rages outside our borders. But privilege demanded action. How could I sit idly by while families were ripped apart, while dreams were crushed under the weight of xenophobia?

I thought of my church friend, a young boy brought here as an infant, DACA application languishing in limbo. Consular processing? A legal entry? As if the system wasn't designed to keep people out.

Europe, lauded for its social safety nets, yet barring birthright citizenship. The U.S., clinging to its Fourteenth Amendment, yet weaponizing immigration laws with ruthless efficiency.

My own anxieties rose. I thought of my wife, a student visa holder. We passed the interview, but she has BPD. Will they deny her permanent residency and deport her.

The world felt heavy, a suffocating mix of fear and anger. But amidst the darkness, there were glimmers of hope. Pedro Pascal, using his platform to speak out against deportations. Small acts of resistance, whispers of humanity in a world desperate for it.

I opened my laptop again, searching for resources, legal aid organizations, anything to help Maria. Maybe prayer wasn't enough, but action was. And I would fight, one hearing, one petition, one act of solidarity at a time, until the system crumbled under the weight of its own inhumanity.
