Okay, lemme whip something up based on all that Reddit doomscrolling.

The phone vibrated: *TexasMonthly.com: The Horse Who Got Deported*. Ugh. Another one. I swiped it away, already feeling the familiar low hum of anxiety. This whole immigration thing…it’s a mess. Like a tangled ball of ethernet cables behind my desk, all knotted and impossible to sort.

I glanced at my smart thermostat. 72 degrees. Perfect meme weather. Maybe I’d just scroll through r/dankmemes for a bit. Distraction was key. But then, another notification. Someone asking about legal help for a Haitian family facing asylum issues. The algorithm *knows*. 

I sighed, cracked open a can of Surge (the original, obviously), and leaned back in my gaming chair. It wasn’t even about politics, really. It was about the sheer *chaos* of it all. People trying to navigate this insane system, birth certificates misspelled, visas expiring, dreams dissolving in a bureaucratic swamp.

Remember that dude stressing about his wife who was scared to apply for her green card? Classic. Fear. That’s the real virus, spreading faster than any TikTok trend.

And then there was that girl who got denied for the B1/B2 Visa. No travel history. Single female. Like the whole damn world is judging you for not being a carbon copy of everyone else. 

It's all just a giant game of whack-a-mole. Every time you think you've found the solution, you are faced with a new problem.

Ironic, isn't it? We're all connected, streaming cat videos and arguing about Star Wars theories, but people are still getting lost in the shuffle, caught in the crossfire of policies and red tape. Maybe I should just build a self sufficient bunker and wait for the world to burn. Nah, not enough bandwidth down there. Probably just watch YouTube videos on hydroponics. That seems more productive, and less stressful. Maybe I will start a farm, and grow my own food.
