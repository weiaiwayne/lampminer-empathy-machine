The flickering screen illuminated my face, another night spent sifting through the digital detritus of Reddit. Tonight, immigration threads. Always a reliable source of…frustration. A young woman in the UK, terrified by the “white paper shit,” wanting to flee to somewhere, anywhere, that doesn’t see her as the antichrist. Then there's Pedro Pascal virtue signaling deportation from Cannes. Virtue, shmirtue.

It’s always the same story, a perpetual cycle of desperation and delusion. People yearning for the American Dream, a dream that’s been increasingly tarnished by reality. They see the shimmering façade, the promise of opportunity, but fail to grasp the grit, the sacrifices, the sheer *work* required to make it here. And the laws, they are bent by every sob story, every invented hardship, every plea for "humanity."

I scoffed, scrolling past a thread about birthright citizenship. "Financial ruin" one poster typed. Finally someone gets it. The Fourteenth Amendment is a ticking time bomb, a magnet for those seeking to exploit our generosity. And the left calls *me* heartless?

My phone buzzed. A notification from a friend, another tech bro, crowing about his latest crypto win. He's probably off to some island to dodge taxes. The irony wasn’t lost on me. We build the tools, the platforms, the very infrastructure that enables this global free-for-all, then complain about the consequences. We're all complicit.

I swiped away the notification, my gaze returning to the glowing screen. A thread about an Afghan national, arriving alone, unable to speak English. I sighed. The world is a mess, a tangled web of broken promises and shattered dreams. And America, for all its flaws, is still the beacon, the last best hope. We need to protect it, to secure our borders, to ensure that those who come here are ready to contribute, to *earn* their place in this great nation. It’s not about hate; it’s about self-preservation. And frankly, I'm tired of apologizing for it.
