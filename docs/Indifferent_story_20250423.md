The Shiba Inu meme coin pumped again today. Predictable, really. I saw a post about some dude stressing over his parents' green card application, a single letter messing everything up. Reminded me of that time I typoed my password and locked myself out of my crypto wallet for a week. Minor inconvenience compared to someone's life, I guess.

Scrolling further, there's a thread about a Canadian trying to get to the US to be with his girlfriend, income requirements and co-sponsors. Relationship goals, right? Except, you know, with a bureaucratic obstacle course thrown in. Saw another about cultural bereavement, someone feeling lost between two worlds. I get that, kinda. Like when your phone updates and all the icons are in different places.

Then there's the Venezuelan guy tackled in the courthouse. Zero empathy, the headline screamed. I saw the video. Messed up. But what can you do, really? More memes, please.

Another article about immigration law, Trump, horrors. Seems like everyone's fighting about something. I just want a stable internet connection and a pizza that doesn't arrive cold. Some dude's worried about his green card expiring, another about a low-quality photo on his DS-160. Tiny anxieties adding up to a big, global mess.

There was a story about someone's mom wanting them to join the military, to prevent her deportation. That's rough. I saw a post about people being denied entry to Georgia just for their skin color. Seems like the world is just a big game of chance, some people get the good loot drops, and some get shafted.

Maybe one day I'll get around to fixing my student loan debt. For now, I think I will just keep scrolling.
