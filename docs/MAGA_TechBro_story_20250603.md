The hum of the server room is my lullaby. Another day, another deluge of digital anxieties flooding the Reddits. This time, it's a Canadian legal assistant mooning over some jarhead in Florida, dreaming of sunshine and a green card shortcut. Bless her heart. She'll learn. They all do.

These peopleâ€¦ they come here, chasing the American dream, but they don't understand what it *means* to be American. It's not just a visa, a job, a better life. It's a responsibility. It's about upholding the Constitution, respecting our traditions, and contributing to the greatness of this nation. Not leeching off it.

I saw a thread about birthright citizenship. A guy on a non-immigrant visa complaining about the potential for financial ruin. He gets it, at least a little. These open borders are a ticking time bomb. The Fourteenth Amendment was written for freed slaves, not for anchor babies. We need to revisit that.

And then there's the poor sap in the Ukraine forum, desperately trying to game the system with a subsidiary company and an L-1 visa. "My passion," he says. Right. Another one looking for a handout.

My phone buzzes. It's a notification from Truth Social. Trump just posted about the "invasion" at the southern border. Good. Someone needs to be talking about this.

I glance at the asylum thread, the guy freaking out before his interview. Eleven years in the US, "trying every option." Maybe it's time he tried going home. 

It's not that I'm heartless. I just believe in order. In rules. In America First. We can't be the world's dumping ground. We need to protect our own, build our own future. These people, they need to understand that. America is a privilege, not a right.

I take a swig of my Mountain Dew. Time to get back to work. The firewalls won't build themselves. And who knows, maybe I'll stumble upon a new meme to share on r/Conservative. Gotta keep the troops motivated.
