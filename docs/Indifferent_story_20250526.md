Okay, here's my attempt at a short story based on my Reddit-fueled worldview, focusing on the daily grind and tech distractions, with a healthy dose of indifference:

The notification pinged, a little blue dot blooming on the corner of my phone screen. "Pedro Pascal addresses Immigration and Deportation..." I swiped it away. Interesting, I guess. Someone's gotta care. I'm just trying to level up in this stupid gacha game before my train arrives.

The subway platform was a symphony of muted anxieties. A guy in a too-tight suit paced, muttering about I-140s and approvals. A woman with a mountain of luggage scrolled through TikTok, her face a mask of forced calm. Probably flying back to Guadalajara, maybe? Or who knows, Kyiv? Not my circus, not my clowns, as they say on the internet.

My train screeched in, a metal leviathan swallowing us whole. I crammed myself into a corner, the smell of stale coffee and existential dread thick in the air. Time for more doom scrolling. Birthright citizenship debates, asylum interviews, visa denials... the algorithm knew what kept me passively engaged. It was all just content, really. Background noise to my quest for that elusive legendary card.

A homeless guy shuffled through the car, his voice a gravelly plea for spare change. I instinctively looked away, focusing on the pixelated world on my phone. Guilt pricked at me, a fleeting discomfort quickly buried under layers of memes and tech reviews.

My stop. I pushed through the crowd, emerging into the blinding sunlight. Time to clock in, fix some printers, maybe troubleshoot someone's VPN. Real problems. Tangible things. The stuff that actually mattered, at least to me.

Later, back in my apartment, I slumped onto the couch, the glow of the TV washing over me. Another day done. Another level achieved. The world outside, with its border disputes and bureaucratic nightmares, felt a million miles away. Maybe tomorrow I'll finally get that new graphics card. That's the kind of immigration I can get behind.
