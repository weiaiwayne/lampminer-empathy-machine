The fluorescent lights of the volunteer center hummed, a soundtrack to my anxiety. Maria, her eyes red-rimmed, clutched a crumpled tissue. Today was it. Her final asylum hearing. I, a citizen by the sheer luck of geography, was her ride, her translator, her witness.

Reading Reddit threads about asylum cases had only amplified my fears. Horror stories of families torn apart, bureaucratic nightmares, and the cold indifference of a system that seemed designed to break people. I thought of Maria's son, Mateo, drawing superheroes in the corner, oblivious to the stakes.

The courtroom was sterile, the air thick with unspoken tension. The judge, a face etched with years of legal battles, droned on about precedents and procedures. Mariaâ€™s voice, barely a whisper, recounted her story of persecution, a narrative of violence and fear I could only comprehend intellectually, never viscerally.

Waiting, I scrolled through my phone. A post about a STEM OPT student's speeding ticket. The anxieties of someone on an H1B visa, navigating the labyrinthine immigration system. Another thread about birthright citizenship, the insidious rhetoric of scarcity and fear creeping into the comments.

Then the verdict. Denied.

The room swam. I wanted to scream, to rage against the injustice. But Maria just closed her eyes, a single tear tracing a path down her cheek. Mateo, sensing the shift in the atmosphere, stopped drawing and clung to his mother.

There was no dramatic expulsion, no immediate separation. Just a date stamped on a piece of paper, a countdown to an impossible choice: self-deportation or hiding in the shadows.

Driving them home, the silence was deafening. I glanced at Mateo, his small hand gripping his mother's. He deserved safety, a future. They all did. And I, with my privileged passport and my comfortable life, felt a burning responsibility to fight for it. The system might be rigged, but we couldn't afford to surrender. We had to keep fighting.
