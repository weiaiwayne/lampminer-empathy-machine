Okay, alright, lemme spin somethin' here.

The glow of the phone was harsh this morning, even dimmed. Another day, another scroll. Reddit was bleedin' again. This time, it was some poor sap's Cuban roommate, outta work permit for "no real reason." Fucked up, man. Just...fucked. Makes you wanna yell at the algorithm or somethin'.

Then there was the dude, the MMA fighter, lookin' for a green card. Tough world, right? Beat the shit outta people for a living, but gotta navigate this insane, broken system just to *stay* here. Irony's a bitch.

My feed's been a constant stream of this kinda stuff lately, just bleeds into the memes and gadget reviews, like oil on water. Asylum seekers terrified, birthright citizenship debates rages, ICE raids loom. It's like everyone's trapped in a goddamn escape room, just clawing at the walls, lookin' for a way out.

I saw a post about some Tiktoker getting detained by ICE. All I could think was "damn, that's gonna be a whole lotta content for someone." But then I felt bad. Like, is that all this is? Just content? Real people, real lives, just fuelin' the outrage machine?

It's like... I'm just here watching the world burn through a screen. I can upvote, downvote, make a snarky comment. Maybe I'll buy a new phone or a noise cancelling headset so I can tune it all out. But that doesn't change anything, does it?

I saw a cool new drone, but then I saw another post, some mom terrified ICE would pick up her kid. I thought, "what does that even mean?". 

Maybe I'll just watch some cat videos. Is that what I have become? Is it so bad if I just dont want to think about it?
