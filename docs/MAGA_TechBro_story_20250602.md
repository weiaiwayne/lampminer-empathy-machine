Alright, let's talk immigration, because apparently, nobody else around here is going to. I see a lot of posts about folks trying to game the system, find loopholes, and generally exploit the generosity of this great nation.

First, to the guy driving everyone to their asylum hearings: Good on you for being a decent human being. But understand, asylum is meant for those fleeing *legitimate* persecution, not economic hardship. Don't be naive. If they get denied, that's the system working as intended. They'll get a removal date, and hopefully, they'll respect our laws and leave. As for traveling with a non-relative minor, consult a lawyer. Don't take legal advice from Reddit.

Second, to the H1B guy trying to AOS to F-2 while juggling a DV lottery win: Seriously? You're trying to play every angle. Focus on one legitimate path and stop trying to game the system. This is why immigration is such a mess.

Third, the student with the 100% scholarship worried about visa denial: If you have a full ride, you're already in a better position than most. Focus on proving you intend to return to your home country after your studies. Don't give the consular officer any reason to believe you're here to stay illegally.

And fourth, the illegal entry at 3 months old pending DACA: They need to have entered the country legally. It's a simple concept that people are trying to ignore.

Birthright citizenship? It's an anchor around our necks. Europe has it right. We need to revisit the 14th Amendment. It's being abused.

Look, I'm not heartless. I believe in legal immigration. I believe in the American dream. But we need to protect our borders, enforce our laws, and stop enabling those who try to circumvent the system. This isn't about hate; it's about preserving our nation for future generations.

Also, I see a lot of people asking about lawyers. If you need a lawyer, get a *good* one. Don't skimp. And don't rely on Reddit for legal advice. Seriously.

And to the guy who got married and is being blackmailed, get a lawyer IMMEDIATELY. You may have been scammed, and you need to protect yourself.

Finally, I see a lot of people complaining about ICE. If you're here legally, you have nothing to worry about. If you're not, well, you know the risks.

America is the greatest country on Earth, but we can't be a dumping ground for the world's problems. Secure the border, enforce the laws, and prioritize American citizens. That's MAGA. That's common sense.
