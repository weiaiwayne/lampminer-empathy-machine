Okay, here's a short story reflecting my current, somewhat cynical, tech-obsessed, and globally-aware outlook:

The phone buzzed. Another notification. “BREAKING: AI-Generated Meme Causes Diplomatic Incident.” I sighed, swiping it away. What was it this time? Deepfakes of world leaders doing the Macarena? 

Outside, the self-driving bus hummed to a stop. I tapped my implant to pay the fare, the transaction processed in milliseconds. Progress, right? Except the bus ad was for a new line of "comfort pods" designed to ease "migratory grief." Apparently, everyone's got it these days, whether they moved across borders or just across town because rent spiked again.

I plugged in my noise-cancelling headphones, the ambient drone of the city fading into digital silence. Time for my daily dose of Reddit. Scrolling through r/immigration, I saw the usual: desperate pleas, bureaucratic nightmares, the quiet despair of people caught in a system that felt designed to break them. One post caught my eye: "Greencard holder in Pakistan, should I risk it?" The comments were a mix of optimism and doomerism, mirroring the eternal online debate. 

Later, at the co-working space (another soul-crushing 60-hour week at my "innovative" tech job), I overheard a conversation about Caracalla's Edict. Some history bro was pontificating about ancient Rome and modern immigration policy. I rolled my eyes. Did he even *know* anyone who’d had to navigate the USCIS hellscape? Probably not.

That night, I dreamt of algorithms and borders, of digital walls and human faces blurred by bad compression. I woke up with a familiar sense of unease. The world was accelerating, but where were we actually going? And who was getting left behind in the digital dust? I grabbed my phone, doomscrolling for answers, or maybe just a distraction. A notification popped up: "New VR Experience: Relive Your Childhood Home, Authentically Recreated." I scoffed. Yeah, that'll fix everything.
