The flickering neon sign of "El Norte Cafe" buzzed outside, casting a sickly green glow on the rain-slicked street. Inside, Maria nervously stirred her watery coffee, the spoon clinking against the ceramic a frantic rhythm against the mariachi music playing softly on the radio. She was waiting. Again. For the only U.S. citizen at her workplace, a tech bro named Chad, to drive her and her son to her final asylum hearing.

Chad arrived, a whirlwind of Axe body spray and libertarian pronouncements. “Don’t worry, Maria, America’s a land of opportunity! Just gotta play the game right. It's like coding, you know? You find the exploit, you run with it.” He gestured with his phone, probably checking his crypto portfolio.

Maria forced a smile. She'd heard his spiel before. He meant well, she thought, but he didn’t *get it*. He saw it as a game, a system to be gamed, while she saw her son's future, her whole life, hanging in the balance.

As they drove, Chad launched into a diatribe about birthright citizenship, ranting about how it was financially unsustainable. Maria stared out the window, watching the endless sprawl of identical houses blur past. She thought of her own home, the one she’d been forced to leave, the one the coyote now held the deed to. She wondered if the new plates on Chad's Tesla were properly secured.

At the courthouse, the air was thick with anxiety. Maria clutched her son's hand. Chad, oblivious, was already on his phone, probably posting about the tyranny of immigration laws.

Maria closed her eyes, whispering a prayer. She didn't need Chad's pronouncements or his coding analogies. She needed a miracle, a glitch in the system that would allow her and her son to stay, to finally find a place where they could belong, not as an exploit, but as human beings. America.
