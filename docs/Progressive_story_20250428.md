The chipped ceramic mug warmed my hands, the lukewarm coffee a meager defense against the chill seeping in from the leaky window. Rain lashed against the glass, mirroring the storm brewing inside me. Another article, another horror story. A four-year-old citizen, *with cancer*, deported. It’s a grotesque parody of justice, a betrayal of everything this country pretends to stand for.

I scrolled through the comments, a toxic sludge of indifference and outright cruelty. “They should have followed the rules.” "Just another anchor baby." The casual dehumanization made my stomach churn. These aren't statistics, they’re children. Families. Human beings ripped apart by a system designed to grind them down.

My own family's story flickered in my mind – the sacrifices, the anxieties, the constant fear of a wrong step leading to disaster. The second-generation American, working 60-hour weeks to barely stay afloat, still facing discrimination in the workplace. The cultural bereavement of those torn between worlds, never truly belonging.

The promise of America, that glittering beacon of opportunity, felt like a cruel joke. A hollow echo of a dream that never was. Caracalla’s edict, granting citizenship to all free men, was a distant, mocking memory. Now, citizenship is a weapon, wielded to exclude, to punish, to erase.

I saw the fear etched on the faces of the undocumented, the desperation in their eyes. I heard the whispers of families contemplating the unthinkable – enlisting their children in the military to buy themselves a shred of security.

The rain intensified, blurring the city lights into a hazy, indistinct mess. I closed my laptop, the screen reflecting my own weary, disillusioned face. The fight for justice felt endless, a Sisyphean task in a world determined to crush hope. But somewhere, deep down, a spark remained. A stubborn refusal to accept this as the new normal. We have to do better. We *must* do better. The future of our society depends on it.
