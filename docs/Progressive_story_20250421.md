The flickering screen illuminated Maya’s face, a landscape of worry etched by the glow. Another Reddit thread, another story of bureaucratic entanglement, another immigrant family caught in the gears of a system that seemed designed to grind them down. This time, it was the DHS, terminating SEVIS based on arrest records, not convictions. Innocent until proven guilty? A quaint notion, apparently, when you weren’t born here.

Maya scrolled, her thumb a blur. She thought of her own parents, their sacrifices, the constant fear that clung to them like a second skin. They'd arrived with the American Dream shimmering in their eyes, only to find a reality of long hours, low wages, and the ever-present threat of deportation. She, a citizen by accident of birth, felt a burning responsibility, a debt she could never fully repay.

The second-generation guilt was a heavy weight. She saw the stories of others like her, caught between two worlds, belonging fully to neither. The South Asian kid facing discrimination despite speaking perfect English. The child of immigrants watching their parents’ dreams curdle into a bitter brew of disillusionment and exhaustion. It was a familiar narrative, a constant reminder that the "American Dream" often came with a hefty price tag – one paid in anxiety, cultural displacement, and the crushing weight of systemic injustice.

She clicked on another thread, this one about a Venezuelan man tackled in a courthouse. The video played, the brutality stark and visceral. Zero empathy, the title screamed. Maya felt a familiar rage building in her chest. The casual violence, the dehumanization, the sheer disregard for human dignity. It was all too common, too predictable.

Closing her laptop, Maya stared out the window. The city lights blurred into a hazy glow. She knew she couldn't fix everything, couldn't dismantle the entire system overnight. But she could fight, could advocate, could amplify the voices of those who were being silenced. She could use her privilege, her education, her citizenship, to push back against the tide of hate and injustice. It wouldn't be easy, but it was the only way she could live with herself. The fight for justice, she realized, was a marathon, not a sprint. And she was just getting started.
