The algorithm whispers anxieties into my feed. A green card holder in Pakistan, paralyzed by the "increasing risk," torn between a half-baked future and the promise of America now. A young South Asian kid, trapped in a cultural pressure cooker, contemplating a marriage with a woman old enough to be his mother, a desperate gamble for a visa. A student facing termination of SEVIS for a mere arrest record, no conviction, just the cold, unfeeling efficiency of the system.

These aren't outliers. They're the canaries in the coal mine, the data points that scream of a system buckling under its own weight. The second-generation American, grinding through toxic tech jobs, facing discrimination despite being a native English speaker, his "American Dream" a mirage in the desert of HCOL and endless hustle. The Venezuelan man, tackled in a courthouse, his face plastered across CNN, reduced to a symbol of the "invasion."

Caracalla's edict. A Roman solution to a Roman problem. Citizenship as a tool, a political calculation. The modern parallel is chilling. Are we building a nation or just expanding a tax base? Are we offering opportunity or exploiting cheap labor?

The "cultural bereavement" of the immigrant, grieving a life left behind, a self lost in translation. The relentless pressure to assimilate, to shed the old skin and don the new, often ill-fitting, one. And the second-generation, caught in the crossfire, never quite belonging, fluent in two languages but fluent in neither culture.

It's not enough to wave the flag and preach American exceptionalism. We need to fix the damn system. Streamline immigration. Prioritize merit, not just family ties. Enforce the laws, but with compassion, not with Gestapo tactics.

And for God's sake, protect our own citizens. The second-generation needs jobs that pay a living wage, not endless hustle and discrimination. They need a society that values their contributions, not one that sees them as perpetual outsiders.

We need to build a better America, a truly exceptional America. An America where opportunity isn't a lottery ticket, but a promise. An America where immigrants are welcomed, not feared. An America where everyone has a chance to live the dream, not just chase it.

Or we can just keep deporting horses.
