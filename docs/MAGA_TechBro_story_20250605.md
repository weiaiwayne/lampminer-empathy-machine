The flickering neon sign of the "Lone Star Motel" buzzed outside, casting a sickly green glow across the dashboard of my F-150. Inside, I swiped through Reddit, the endless scroll a digital river reflecting the anxieties of the world back at me.

First, a plea from a Canadian, a damn Canuck, wanting to jump ship to Texas, dreaming of a life shared with friends. Good riddance to Trudeau, I thought. America’s still the land of opportunity, even if the woke left doesn't see it.

Then, the grim reality of immigration court. Someone driving folks to asylum hearings, wondering if their friends will vanish into the system, another cog in the machine. Sad.

A student, scholarship in hand, terrified of a visa denial. Kid probably thinks America is racist or something.

But there was also this other theme, a creeping unease. The fear of ICE, the desperation to stay, the constant shadow of deportation orders. A woman in NC, terrified for her mixed-race kid, fearing a raid. Another one fearing that something from the past can affect citizenship.

And the birthright citizenship debate. Even legal immigrants are seeing the financial ruin coming.

It’s a damn mess. I can see both sides. I believe in the American dream, but I also believe in securing the border. We can't just let anyone walk in and suck the system dry.

The radio crackled to life, some NPR garbage about climate change. I switched it off. Outside, a beat-up sedan with a Texas flag sticker sputtered past, heading west. Probably someone chasing the same dream, the same piece of the pie.

I lit a Marlboro, the smoke curling into the humid night air. This country, it’s a pressure cooker. Dreams and anxieties, all simmering together. Gotta be tough, gotta be smart, gotta be American. That's what it takes to survive. This woke stuff is going to kill us.
