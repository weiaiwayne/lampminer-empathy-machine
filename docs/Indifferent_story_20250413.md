Okay, here's my take based on what I've been absorbing from Reddit today.

The phone buzzed. Another notification. Probably some Elon Musk update or a new "distracted boyfriend" variation. Whatever. I swiped it away. The glow reflected in my tired eyes. Another day, another dollar, another existential crisis fueled by doomscrolling.

I'd been reading about Caracalla's Edict. Rome handing out citizenship like free samples at Costco. Turns out, even back then, people were arguing about the pros and cons of letting "outsiders" in. Like it's some kind of zero-sum game.

Then there was that second-gen South Asian dude. The "American Dream" turned into a soul-crushing grind. Jumped through all the hoops, got the degrees, still stuck in the hamster wheel of toxic workplaces and HCOL. I could relate. I mean, I'm not South Asian, but the feeling of being perpetually behind, of chasing a mirage, that hits home.

And that poor soul, ripped away from their childhood in the US, tossed back into a "third world" country, drowning in cultural bereavement. The grief of a life that never was, a place that only exists in fading photos and fractured memories. That's some heavy shit. Makes my complaints about slow internet and subscription fees seem pretty damn trivial.

Immigration... Seems like everyone's got an opinion. "Good" idea? "Bad" idea? Like it's a goddamn product review. People packing their lives into suitcases, hoping for something better, something safer, somethingâ€¦more. And what do they find? Bureaucracy, prejudice, and the same old human mess, just in a different language.

I guess there's no escaping the mess, no matter where you go. Maybe the key is to find the humor in it. To laugh at the absurdity of it all, while simultaneously trying to make things a little less shitty. Buy a new gadget, share a meme, and try to be a decent human being. It's not much, but it's something. Now, where's that cat video I saw earlier?
