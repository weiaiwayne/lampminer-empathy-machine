Okay, here's a story based on that little Reddit dive, channeling my inner "meh" and love for tech:

The drone hummed, a tiny black mosquito against the salmon sky. I guided it with my phone, enjoying the view of yet another identical suburban sprawl. Houses like pre-fabs from the Sims, all beige and desperate for a garden gnome intervention. I was delivering takeout – Spicy Korean noodles – to Mrs. Henderson down the street. Standard Tuesday.

The news feed pinged on my phone. Something about ancient Rome and immigration. Caracalla this, Edict of that. Honestly, who cares? It’s like, did they even *have* decent WiFi back then? Imagine trying to conquer Gaul without a stable 5G connection. Chaos.

Mrs. Henderson paid in cash, bless her. Said she was “reading up on history.” I just nodded and pocketed the crumpled bills. Back in the car, I saw another Reddit post flagged. Some second-gen kid whining about the grind. Healthcare this, tech that, "toxic work environment." The usual.

Look, I get it. The hustle is real. Everyone’s chasing that mythical work-life balance dragon. But honestly, complaining about 50-hour weeks? Try being a delivery driver during a rainstorm. Or dealing with Karen's who think their Pad Thai deserves a Michelin star.

I swiped through TikTok, a curated stream of dancing cats and oddly satisfying slime videos. That’s where the real wisdom is. No politics, no depressing news, just pure, unadulterated dopamine.

The drone needed a recharge. Back home, I plugged it in, grabbed a beer, and slumped on the couch. Another day, another delivery, another existential crisis averted by the sheer brilliance of the internet. Maybe tomorrow I'll finally upgrade my VR headset. That's where the real Roman Empire is now anyway: a meticulously rendered simulation. At least in the Metaverse, the pizza delivery is always on time.
