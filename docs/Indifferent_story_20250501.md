Okay, lemme cook.

The meme was fire. A bewildered Shiba Inu staring at a spreadsheet labeled "HCOL vs. Salary Expectations." Relatable AF. Scrolling down, though, the feed got heavy. Deported kids with cancer? Jesus. It's like watching a glitchy VR game where the happy puppy simulator suddenly throws in a level about dystopian border control.

I tapped through to the article about the horse. A *horse* got deported? What in the actual Kentucky Fried Fiasco is going on? It's almost funny, but then you remember it's probably some poor farmer's livelihood getting screwed.

Then there's the constant stream of visa woes, green card anxieties, and the generalized panic about being a non-citizen in theseâ€¦ *interesting* times. It's like everyone's playing a high-stakes game of immigration sim, and the rules keep changing mid-game. One thread got me thinking. Some dude's wife is convinced she can't get a green card, even though a lawyer says she's good to go. Paranoia, man. It's a virus.

I gotta admit, I'm starting to feel it too. Not about deportation, obviously. I'm a citizen. But that second-gen American who was whining about the job market? I felt that. Grind, grind, grind, for what? A slightly bigger screen on my next phone?

Maybe Caracalla was onto something. Give everyone citizenship, and boom, problem solved. Except, knowing the internet, that'd just lead to new problems. "Romans Against Pineapple on Pizza" or some crap.

Ironic, isn't it? We've got the tech to connect the whole world, but we're building digital walls faster than ever. Maybe I *should* start learning that coding language. If this whole thing goes sideways, I'm gonna need a good VPN to access the dankest memes from whatever bunker I end up in.

Time for a dopamine detox. Back to cat videos. At least those are universally wholesome... mostly.
