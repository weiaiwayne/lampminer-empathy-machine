The notification chimed on my phone: "New Nvidia drivers available." Finally! I mashed the update button, already picturing the ray-traced reflections in *Cyberpunk 2077* looking even *more* chrome. While that downloaded, I scrolled through Reddit, half-listening to the latest lofi beats compilation.

Then I saw it: "US Just Raised Tariffs on China to 125%!" Ugh, tariffs. Seriously? It always messes with the price of stuff. First GPUs, now what? I guess I should care, right? Something about bulk shipping, splitting shipments... sounds like a headache. I'm just trying to get my hands on the new RGB keyboard. Will *that* be affected? Sigh.

Below that was a post from someone trying to sell planners on Shopify. SEO this, bundle apps that... It's just like, so many options to sell stuff and so much competition. I guess you gotta hustle.

Honestly, the world feels like one giant, chaotic marketplace. Everyone's trying to sell something, everyone's trying to game the system, and governments are throwing wrenches into the gears with tariffs and regulations. And me? I'm just here for the tech, the memes, and maybe a decent cup of coffee.

I saw a meme about a dog wearing sunglasses that made me laugh. Better than thinking about international trade, right?

The download finished. I fired up *Cyberpunk*. The neon glow of Night City washed over my face. For a moment, the tariffs, the SEO, the endless hustle faded away. Just me, my rig, and some sweet, sweet polygons. Maybe ignorance *is* bliss.
