Okay, so after scrolling through Reddit today, here’s what’s bouncing around in my head.

The airport hotel was buzzing, not with vacationers, but with a weird, tense energy. I was just trying to snag a decent rate for Comic-Con next month, but the lobby felt like a set from a bad spy movie. Guys in dark suits, too-serious expressions, the kind who look like they practice glaring in the mirror. Saw one dude with a "tactical" backpack that looked like it could survive a nuclear winter. Probably just had a laptop and a protein bar in there, but still.

Then I saw the news about the kid, the one who came here when he was practically a baby, now stressing about ICE. Like, seriously? He’s got a job, a work permit, probably pays taxes. What’s the point of all this? It's like when the cops pulled over my friend because his taillight was out, but then they spent 20 minutes asking him where he was born.

It’s all just…layers of stress. Like that traffic ticket post. First ticket ever, and now this dude has to navigate the whole court system, worry about points on his license. It’s like the universe is designed to make things as difficult as possible. I saw a meme about it, actually – a picture of a cat trying to get through a doorway filled with lasers, captioned "Life." Accurate.

The other thing is, everyone’s just trying to find a workaround. The "self-deport or marriage" post? Depressing. Like, love shouldn't be a legal loophole. But you can't blame the person for trying to find a way to live their life.

I’m just trying to avoid all of it. New earbuds dropped today, noise-canceling, supposed to be amazing. Maybe if I just crank up the music loud enough, I can drown out the anxiety. Maybe I'll just post a reaction meme and move on.
