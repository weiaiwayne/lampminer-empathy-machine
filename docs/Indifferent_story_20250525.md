Okay, so like, I was scrolling through Reddit, right? Just killing time before the new iPhone drops. And it's the usual chaos, people stressed about visas, green cards, ICEâ€¦ the whole shebang. Makes you kinda numb, you know? Like, another day, another deportation story.

But then I see this one post, "Any couples that self-deported to Mexico..." and it kinda stuck with me. Not like I *care*, care. But imagine ditching everything, your whole life here, because the system's so messed up, you'd rather start over somewhere else. That's some serious commitment, or maybe desperation, I dunno.

I picture them, packing up their beat-up Corolla, kids crammed in the back with their Gameboys. Driving south, leaving behind everything they worked for. Maybe they had a nice apartment, a steady job, even a shot at the American Dream. But now it's gone, replaced by dust and uncertainty.

And then there's the other stuff, like this dude stressing about his asylum interview, wondering if his life was just a "bad experiment." Dude's been here for eleven years! That's longer than I've been into coding! It's messed up that people can just be stuck, like a glitch in the matrix.

Then there's the birthright citizenship thing, which, honestly, I couldn't care less about. But some dude is saying it's gonna bankrupt the country. Like, seriously? Is that even a thing? Sounds like some boomer meme, but who knows anymore.

So yeah, that's the world, I guess. A bunch of people hustling, trying to make it work, while the government throws wrenches into everything. Me? I'm just waiting for the new phone. Maybe it'll have a better camera, or finally, a decent battery life. Maybe it'll distract me from all this...until the next scroll.
