The flickering screen illuminated Ameliaâ€™s face, casting shadows that danced with the anxiety churning in her gut. Reddit, her constant companion, whispered tales of bureaucratic nightmares and broken dreams. She scrolled through the endless stream of anxieties, each post a tiny ship tossed on a turbulent sea of immigration law. Caracalla's edict felt like a cruel joke, a distant promise of universal belonging mocked by the present reality of walls and red tape.

Amelia, a devout Christian, wrestled with the dissonance. The Bible spoke of welcoming the stranger, of radical hospitality, yet the digital world painted a picture of scarcity, of fear-driven policies that prioritized national identity over human dignity. She prayed for guidance, for a way to reconcile her faith with the anxieties that gnawed at her.

A young couple, barely out of college, debated whether to file for adjustment of status, their love story threatened by the specter of denial. Another soul, scarred by cultural bereavement, cried out for understanding, lost between a homeland they could never truly reclaim and a new world that felt forever alien. Amelia saw the fear in their words, the desperation to build a life, a family, a future.

She thought of Jesus, himself a refugee, fleeing Herod's wrath. What would He say to these digital wanderers, these modern-day pilgrims seeking refuge? Would He offer platitudes or practical assistance? Amelia knew the answer resided in both. She resolved to temper her anxieties with compassion, to actively seek ways to support those navigating the labyrinthine system. Prayer, yes, but also action. A donation to a legal aid organization, a listening ear to a friend struggling with their application, a voice raised in support of just immigration reform.

The digital world could be a breeding ground for fear, but it could also be a conduit for empathy. Amelia clicked off the screen, the flickering light replaced by the quiet glow of her faith. The path ahead remained uncertain, but she knew, with unwavering conviction, that love and justice demanded she walk it.
