The meme of the distracted boyfriend flickered in my mind, except it was me, perpetually distracted by the latest iPhone rumor while the burning dumpster of geopolitics raged behind me. Caracalla, huh? Citizenship for everyone. Sounds like a policy ripe for exploitation by both sides. Probably crashed the Roman economy, or something.

Scrolling through Reddit, it's a constant barrage of anxieties. Someone's dad got deported because of a speeding ticket. Another's wife is convinced the US government is actively trying to break them up. The weight of it all is heavy, a low hum beneath the surface of my desire for a new noise-canceling headset.

This one guy, though, the second-generation American. That hits different. Parents came here, worked hard, achieved the dream. Now he's grinding, changing jobs every year, stuck in the HCOL treadmill. Toxic workplaces, discrimination based on looks. It's almost like the "American Dream" is just a cleverly disguised hamster wheel. He sounds like he needs a better gig. Maybe a remote cybersecurity job that pays in crypto. 

The au pair program... that's kinda sus. All those young women coming over, vulnerable, probably getting exploited. And the guy whose wife is an asylum seeker? Man, navigating the USCIS is like playing a video game designed by Kafka. No wonder she's freaked out. 

Someone's always trying to get somewhere else, find something better. Canada, Mexico, back "home" to places they barely remember. Everyone's just looking for a cheat code to life, a way to bypass the grind.

Maybe the best I can do is ignore it all, and just buy the new VR headset and immerse myself in a digital world where the rules make sense, and the only thing that matters is getting to the next level. But even that feels like a cop-out. A high-tech form of apathy. Apathy. It's a hell of a drug.
