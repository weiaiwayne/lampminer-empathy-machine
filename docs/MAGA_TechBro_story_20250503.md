The flickering neon sign of "Liberty Diner" cast a greasy glow on the rain-slicked street. Inside, Maria scrubbed the countertop, the scent of stale coffee clinging to her like a second skin. She'd been here for fifteen years, a silent fixture in the American landscape, her hands calloused with the labor that built this nation.

Her son, Marco, tapped furiously on his phone in a booth, his brow furrowed. He was scrolling through news articles, his youthful face etched with worry. Another story of deportations, of families torn apart, of the fear that had become a constant hum in their lives. He was born here, an American citizen, yet the shadow of his mother's status haunted him.

"Mijo, don't worry so much," Maria said, her voice a low murmur. "We are strong. We work hard. This is our home." But even as she spoke, a sliver of doubt crept into her heart. The news was relentless, the rhetoric sharp, the promises of a secure future growing fainter with each passing day.

She thought of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, wrongly deported, his wife forced into hiding. She remembered the four-year-old child with cancer, deported with his family. These weren't just headlines; they were echoes of her own anxieties, the fear that a simple mistake, a bureaucratic error, could shatter their lives.

Marco looked up, his eyes filled with a mixture of anger and despair. "But Mom, it's not fair! I shouldn't have to live like this, always looking over my shoulder." He dreamed of a future in tech, of building the next great app, but the constant threat of his family being ripped apart cast a pall over his ambitions.

Maria sighed. She knew his frustrations. He wanted to be seen, to be valued, to be free from the burden of his mother's past. But she also knew the resilience of the immigrant spirit, the unwavering belief in the promise of America, even when that promise felt like a cruel joke.

"We keep fighting, mijo," she said, her voice firm. "We keep working, we keep praying, and we keep believing that one day, this country will see us for who we are: Americans, just like everyone else." She squeezed his hand, her calloused fingers offering a silent reassurance. Outside, the rain continued to fall, washing the streets clean, but the fear lingered, a cold draft seeping through the cracks in their American dream.
