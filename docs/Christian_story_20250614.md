The cicadas buzzed their relentless song, a sound I now associate with unease. It was the soundtrack to Maria's frantic phone call, her voice a tightrope stretched thin with fear. Her father, a good man, a hard worker whoâ€™d overstayed his visa, was talking about finding work in Nevada. A desperate gamble. I prayed for him, for Maria, for the child she carried, a future American citizen whose life was already knotted with uncertainty.

I scrolled through Reddit, a digital echo chamber of anxieties. A young DACA recipient accidentally signed up for self-deportation. A green card holder, approved for permanent residency, stuck in bureaucratic purgatory, unable to prove his status for job applications. I felt a tightening in my chest. The threads intertwined, a tapestry of human striving and the cold, indifferent machinery of the state.

Pedro Pascal, that Chilean-American actor, speaking out at Cannes about deportations. A good, righteous stand. But words felt flimsy against the rising tide of fear.

Then, a story about a TikTok star detained by ICE. Khaby Lame. Even fame, it seemed, offered no sanctuary. The world felt precarious, the ground shifting beneath our feet.

I opened my Bible, searching for solace. "The Lord is my refuge and my fortress," Psalm 91 declared. But faith felt like a fragile shield against the storm. I thought of the scripture about welcoming the stranger, about caring for the vulnerable. Yet, here we were, a nation built on immigration, now seemingly determined to slam the door shut.

I closed my eyes, picturing my own ancestors, fleeing persecution, seeking a better life on these shores. Would they be welcome today?

I prayed for wisdom, for compassion, for a softening of hearts. I prayed for Maria's father, for the DACA recipient, for Khaby Lame, for all those caught in the crosshairs of a system that seemed to have lost its way. The cicadas continued their drone, a relentless reminder of the world's anxieties, a world desperately in need of grace.
