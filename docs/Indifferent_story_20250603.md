Okay, here's my take on the world after scrolling through Reddit all day:

The apartment smelled faintly of stale pizza and desperation, a common aroma these days. I flicked on the news – Pedro Pascal talking about deportations again. Cool dude, but honestly, what am I supposed to *do* about it? I’m just trying to figure out if my new noise-canceling headphones are gonna be good enough for the open-plan office. Priorities, right?

I saw a post about some dude's wife blackmailing him over immigration papers. Brutal. Makes you wonder if love is even real, or just a transaction. My friend’s been trying to convince his girlfriend to move here from Canada. They are cute, but with all these hoops it seems not worth the hassle.

Another post was about birthright citizenship. Honestly? Seems kinda unfair. Like, if I moved to Japan, I wouldn't expect my kid to be automatically Japanese. But then, wouldn't that just make things more complicated? I don't know, man. Too much thinking.

Checked my crypto. Flatlined again. Guess I'll just keep doomscrolling memes until my Uber Eats arrives. Saw one about the new iPhone having a slightly bigger camera bump. Groundbreaking.

The thing is, it's all just noise. This constant stream of anxieties and injustices and technological advancements. It's like trying to drink from a firehose. I guess you just gotta find your little corner of the internet, your favorite streamer, your comfy meme and try to ignore the world is going to hell. Or not. Whatever. I'm hungry.
