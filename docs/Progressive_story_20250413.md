The chipped mug warmed my hands, the lukewarm tea doing little to soothe the knot in my chest. Another Reddit thread, another story of someone caught in the gears of a system that was supposed to offer opportunity, not grind them down. This time, it was a second-generation American, South Asian heritage, drowning in the very "American Dream" their parents chased. The irony was a bitter taste.

I scrolled past the hopeful pleas for immigration advice, the anxieties about greencard delays, and landed on a post that resonated with a frightening clarity: migratory grief, the ache for a home that no longer existed, or perhaps, never truly did. The writer, ripped from a childhood in the US and thrust back into a "third world" country, spoke of a cultural bereavement that dwarfed any simple longing. A ghost limb, a phantom language on the tongue.

Caracalla's Edict flickered in my memory - citizenship for all, a facade of unity masking the empire's rot. Was that what America offered now? A citizenship that felt conditional, a belonging perpetually questioned, a promise of stability shattered by recessions and toxic workplaces?

I imagined her, this ghost-limb immigrant, walking down a crowded street, the cacophony of a foreign language a constant reminder of her displacement. The faces around her blurred, none reflecting the childhood she clutched, the "real and fake" memories of a life left behind. The weight of it all, the sheer, suffocating *unfairness* of being uprooted, replanted, and then left to wither.

It wasn't just about borders and laws, about visas and green cards. It was about the human cost, the invisible wounds inflicted by a system that prioritized economic gain over human dignity. It was about the insidious racism that whispered, "You don't belong," even when the paperwork said otherwise.

I closed my laptop, the glow fading from my face. The fight wasn't just about policy, it was about empathy. It was about recognizing the shared humanity in every immigrant story, the courage it took to leave everything behind, and the quiet despair of realizing that the promised land wasn't always what it seemed. The tea was cold now, but the fire in my belly burned hotter than ever. The system needed to change, not just for the sake of immigrants, but for the soul of a nation that claimed to welcome them.
