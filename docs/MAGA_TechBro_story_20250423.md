The hum of the server room was a constant, low thrum, a technological heartbeat I’d grown accustomed to. Tonight, it vibrated with a different kind of anxiety. I scrolled through the Reddit feeds, the glowing screen reflecting in my tired eyes. Another story of a Venezuelan man tackled in a courthouse, another H1B on the rocks, another green card holder facing bureaucratic nightmares. The American Dream, huh? More like the American Gauntlet.

Caracalla gave citizenship to everyone, the Romans understood the value of bringing people into the fold. Now we deport people for trying to find a better life?

This morning, I had been optimizing code, writing algorithms to streamline data flow. Now, the data was faces, stories, anxieties. The second-generation American, toiling in a toxic tech environment, feeling the sting of prejudice despite speaking perfect English. The au pair, navigating visa renewals and the fear of being sent back. The elderly mother, facing the cold reality of dwindling resources.

It all felt…broken. The system, the promise, the very idea of meritocracy. I believed in hard work, in pulling yourself up by your bootstraps, in the innovative spirit that built Silicon Valley. But the bootstraps were frayed, the ladder had missing rungs, and the game was rigged.

The world outside the server room was changing. Trump was on the rise. The woke left was destroying America. The culture wars raged. And here I was, a digital architect in a crumbling empire, watching the human cost unfold in real-time.

I closed my laptop, the sudden darkness amplifying the hum. I needed a drink, a long drive, something to cut through the digital noise. Maybe I'd fire up the old Mustang, crank some Skynyrd, and remember what it felt like to be free on the open road. Maybe there was still some America left worth fighting for. Maybe.
