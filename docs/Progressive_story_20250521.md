The fluorescent hum of the community center buzzed in my ears, a soundtrack to the anxieties clinging to the air like dust motes. Tonight was "Know Your Rights" night, a necessity in this climate of fear. Maria clutched my hand, her knuckles white. She was the one facing her final asylum hearing next week. The memory of her Reddit post about it flashed in my mind. I tried to offer a reassuring smile, but my own stomach churned.

Across the room, a young man with tired eyes fidgeted with a worn copy of the Constitution. Heâ€™d come seeking advice about his U4U status, another temporary band-aid on a gaping wound in our immigration system. He was a Ukrainian coder, dreaming of building a business, contributing to this country, but trapped in bureaucratic limbo. I imagined him hunched over his laptop, fueled by coffee and desperation, trying to navigate the L-1 visa labyrinth.

My gaze drifted to a cluster of college students, their faces a mix of hope and apprehension. They were DACA recipients, their futures perpetually dangling by a thread. One of them caught my eye and gave a small, grateful nod. I remembered their stories, buried in the digital archives of Reddit: the fear of a denied F1 visa, the injustice of birthright citizenship denied, the gut-wrenching reality of deportation orders tearing families apart.

I thought of Pedro Pascal, using his platform to speak out against these injustices. His words resonated, a beacon in the darkness. But words weren't enough. We needed action, systemic change, a dismantling of the structures that perpetuated this cycle of fear and oppression.

I squeezed Maria's hand tighter. "We've got this," I whispered, even though I didn't know if it was true. We would fight for her, for the coder, for the students, for everyone caught in the web of our broken immigration system. We would amplify their voices, challenge the narratives, and demand a future where justice and compassion prevailed. Because anything less was unacceptable. The hum of the fluorescent lights seemed to intensify, urging us on, a constant reminder of the work that lay ahead.
