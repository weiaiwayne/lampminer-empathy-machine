Okay, so like, I was scrolling through Reddit the other day, you know, killing time between TikTok binges and trying to figure out if this new phone case I saw on Insta is actually worth the hype. Anyway, I stumbled into this immigration rabbit hole. It was wild. People stressing about visas, green cards, getting deported… seriously heavy stuff.

This one thread, this guy was asking about getting a consultant for his O1 visa, like the “extraordinary talent” one. I was thinking, damn, that's gotta be intense. Meanwhile, other people are posting about ICE raids and being scared to leave their house. Talk about opposite ends of the spectrum, right?

Then there's the marriage stuff. People getting married for green cards, people getting blackmailed, and some dude's wife thinking *he's* mentally abusing *her* after she cheated. Like a soap opera. It reminded me of that meme with the dog sipping tea, “But that’s none of my business.”

Honestly, it made my head spin. I'm over here worried about which streaming service to subscribe to, and these people are dealing with life-altering, country-changing decisions. It's kinda like, the world is burning, but I'm just trying to find the right filter for my selfie. 

It's easy to get caught up in the daily grind, the new gadgets, the drama, the memes. But then you see these glimpses into other people's lives, and it's like, woah, there's a whole other level of reality happening.

So, yeah, I'm still gonna watch cat videos and argue about Marvel movies online. But I guess I'll try to remember that there's more to the world than my phone screen. Maybe. If I can remember amidst the constant barrage of dopamine hits.
