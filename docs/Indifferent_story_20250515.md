Okay, world according to me, a guy chilling on Reddit in 2025? It's a mixed bag, fam. Like a meme compilation where some are fire and some are just... *there*.

My phone buzzes with a post about a family ripped apart by deportation.  The comments are a dumpster fire. Some are screaming about laws, others about basic human decency. I scroll past, the knot in my stomach tightening.  It's always the same.  Ancient Romans arguing about citizenship, modern families torn apart, all just lines on a map.

Then, a thread about this South African group seeking refuge.  Afrikaners?  Feels weird, like history doing a glitch. I guess everyone just wants a safe place to land, huh?  Even the people who used to make it unsafe for others.  

A little further down, someone's asking about getting an engineering degree so they can come to America, and someone else is complaining about how hard the grind is *after* they get here. It is always something. A green card is always greener on the other side.

I see the same questions, over and over. "Is it worth it?" "Am I screwed?"  "Can they take my kids?"  I scroll past those, too. I am not qualified to answer that. I'm just a guy looking at tech reviews and trying to find a good deal on a new VR headset.

But these stories keep piling up. And you start to see patterns. There's this constant pull, this desperate need for something better, even if "better" is just...less awful. And there's this constant fear, this gnawing feeling that the rug could be pulled out from under you any second. People are scared, and they are right to be.

I flick on some lo-fi beats, try to ignore the creeping anxiety.  Maybe that VR headset will help.  Maybe a few hours lost in a digital world is all I need.  Another meme flashes across my screen: "This is fine."  I laugh a little, but it feels hollow.  The world keeps spinning, the algorithms keep churning, and I'm just trying to keep my head above water, one meme, one gadget, one day at a time.
