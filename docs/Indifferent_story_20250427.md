The notification chimed on my phone: "New RTX 5090 Ti leaked specs - 24GB GDDR7X, $2500 MSRP." Sweet. Another incremental jump in performance for a price that ensures I'll be stuck playing Elden Ring on medium settings for another year.

I swiped away, thumbing through Reddit. Immigration drama, naturally. Someone's wife fearing deportation, another person's green card expiring. The usual. It's like a Kafka novel, but with more paperwork and less existential dread. Or maybe the dread is just hidden under layers of memes and tech reviews.

Then there's the H1B visa stuff, O1 visa issues. All these people chasing the "American Dream" while I'm just trying to find a job that doesn't require me to answer emails at 10 PM. Funny how dreams shift. My grandparents came here chasing opportunity. Now, it seems like everyone is just chasing stability, a little bit of breathing room in a world that keeps squeezing tighter.

Scrolling further, a horse got deported? Seriously? What timeline are we living in?

I closed Reddit and opened YouTube. Linus Tech Tips was doing a comparison of the latest noise-canceling headphones. Ah, sweet oblivion. Maybe if I crank the bass high enough, I can drown out the existential hum of late-stage capitalism and the constant anxiety of reading about other people's immigration woes.

The world felt like a poorly optimized video game. Glitches everywhere, the framerate drops to zero at crucial moments, and the promised DLC (a stable future, a decent work-life balance) is perpetually delayed. Still, I'll probably pre-order the next expansion anyway.
