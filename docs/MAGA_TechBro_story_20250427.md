The flickering neon sign of "Tech Solutions" cast a sickly green glow on Raj Patel’s face as he scrolled through Reddit. Another H1B denied. Another family facing deportation. The stories bled together, a digital tapestry of anxieties woven by red tape and shifting political winds.

Raj, a staunch believer in American ingenuity and the power of the free market, felt a knot tighten in his stomach. He remembered his own father, a software engineer who arrived in the States with nothing but a suitcase and a dream. Now, his son, a Harvard graduate, struggled to find a job in the oversaturated market, the tech giants seemingly more interested in outsourcing and exploiting cheap labor than investing in American talent.

He clicked on a thread about Caracalla’s Edict, the ancient Roman emperor who granted citizenship to all free men. A naive move, he thought, diluting the strength of Rome. Yet, wasn't there a modern echo in the promise of America? Land of opportunity, open to all? He scoffed. The opportunity seemed to be shrinking, choked by regulations and a culture of entitlement.

He glanced at the news feed. Another article about some Venezuelan migrant arrested, the comments section a cesspool of xenophobia and fear. Raj felt a pang of guilt. He, too, harbored anxieties about the open border, about the strain on resources, about the erosion of American values. But demonizing an entire group of people? That wasn't the American way.

He closed his laptop, the green light fading. He thought of his grandfather, a farmer in Gujarat, who dreamed of a better life for his children. He had found it in America, a land where hard work and determination were supposed to be rewarded. But now, that promise seemed increasingly fragile, threatened by forces both internal and external. He resolved to redouble his efforts. He would build something, create jobs, invest in American innovation. He would fight to preserve the dream, even if it meant challenging the very system that had once embraced his family. The American dream was worth fighting for, but it needed MAGA to make it real again.
