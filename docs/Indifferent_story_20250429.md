The phone buzzed, another notification from Reddit. Ugh, immigration stuff again. Seems like everyone's either trying to get *in* or trying to keep someone *out*. Honestly, I just wanna see what new phone Samsung's gonna drop next year.

But then, something about a four-year-old with cancer getting deported caught my eye. Jesus. A *kid*? With *cancer*? That's some next-level garbage. What kind of soulless algorithm makes that happen? Makes you wonder if these ICE guys even see the people they're processing, or just dollar signs and statistics.

Then there's the flip side. That post about the Aussie IT guy trying to get here to be with his girl. He's over 35, so no easy working holiday visa for him. It's like, you can invent the next iPhone, and they'll roll out the red carpet. But if you're just a regular dude trying to find some happiness, good luck navigating the bureaucratic maze.

And then there's the dude whose wife is scared shitless that her past will screw up her green card application. You know, all this stuff just makes me think of the metaverse and how we are all just gonna escape into digital realities soon.

It's all justâ€¦ messy. Like, I get the need for borders, I guess. But the human cost is just brutal. You see the stories, the families torn apart, the futures put on hold, and it's hard not to feel like we're all just cogs in some giant, broken machine. 

Anyway, gotta go. Just saw a meme about a dog wearing Crocs. Need that brain bleach. Maybe I'll start a TikTok about tech reviews or something. Much less depressing.
