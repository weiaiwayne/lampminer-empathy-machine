The flickering screen illuminated my face, a mosaic of Reddit threads reflecting in my eyes. Caracalla's edict, a second-generation immigrant's lament, a cry of migratory grief – all swirling in the digital ether. It reminded me of the Tower of Babel. We humans, scattered and yearning, building digital towers hoping for connection, for understanding, for a home.

The story of the South Asian son, grinding in a toxic system, resonated. He sought the American Dream, only to find a soul-crushing treadmill. Where is the shalom in that? Where is the rest God promises? It's a broken world, I thought, tainted by sin, where even the promise of opportunity becomes a gilded cage.

Then there was the Venezuelan man tackled in the courthouse. A jarring image. Justice, meant to be blind, seemed to stumble, blinded by prejudice. I recalled Proverbs 16:8, "Better a little with righteousness than much gain with injustice." The agents, in their zeal, forgot the dignity of the man, the image of God stamped on his very being.

The threads on immigration law, on H1B visas, on the fear of deportation – a tangled web of human lives caught in bureaucratic machinery. Each click a prayer for mercy, for understanding, for a path forward. And the mother in Mexico, wanting to give birth in America for better care. The same basic human desire for safety and well-being, the same longing that drove the Israelites to the promised land.

But the story that truly pierced my heart was the child whose parents wanted him to enlist in the military to prevent their deportation. A child sacrificing his own future, his own dreams, on the altar of parental security. This is not the way it should be. This is not God's intention. It is a distortion of family, a consequence of policies that dehumanize and divide.

I closed my laptop, the glow fading. The digital world offered glimpses of hope, connection, and shared struggle. But it also amplified the brokenness, the injustice, the fear. My calling, I realized, was not just to understand the world through theological lenses, but to be a light in the darkness, a voice for the voiceless, a hand extended in compassion. To seek shalom, not just for myself, but for all those caught in the currents of this fallen world. To be a witness to the Kingdom, where justice and mercy meet.
