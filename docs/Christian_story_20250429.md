The weight of the world settled on my shoulders, heavier than any pew I'd ever knelt upon. It wasn't the simple weight of sin, but a complex tapestry woven with threads of hope and despair, fear and longing, justice and injustice. Reddit, that sprawling digital town square, had been my accidental teacher, revealing the raw, unfiltered stories of God's children navigating a broken world.

I thought of Caracalla, that Roman emperor granting citizenship, a fleeting echo of God's grace extended to all. But even then, as now, grace was met with fear, with anxieties about dwindling resources and shifting power. I saw it in the anxieties of the second-generation American, caught between two worlds, striving for the promised land of stability, only to find a landscape of toxic work environments and relentless pressure. Where was the Sabbath rest in all this striving? Where was the fruit of labor the bible talked about?

Then there was the grief. The woman, exiled from a childhood American dream, returned to a land where she felt a stranger, haunted by "migratory grief," a pain that no one seemed to understand. It reminded me of the Israelites wandering in the desert, yearning for a homeland they barely remembered, facing constant threat.

And the stories kept coming: delays, denials, deportations. A Salvadoran father, fearing Cecot, the brutal prison, his cross tattoo a mark of faith turned into a potential target. A wife, forced into hiding after the government carelessly exposed her address. A child, a US citizen, ripped from her home, deported with cancer. The world was not as it should be.

But amidst the darkness, flickers of light remained. The desire for community, for connection, shone through in the desperate search for pro bono lawyers, the yearning for a safe place to rehearse immigration interviews. The small acts of kindness, a friend offering to care for an elderly mother, a stranger willing to share their experience navigating Advance Parole.

These were the seeds of hope, the tiny acts of grace that reminded me that even in the midst of chaos, God's love endures. My role, I realized, wasn't to offer easy answers or simplistic solutions, but to bear witness, to offer comfort, and to pray for the strength to act with justice and compassion, guided by the wisdom of scripture and the unwavering love of Christ. The world was broken, yes, but it was also filled with the potential for redemption, one small act of faith at a time.
