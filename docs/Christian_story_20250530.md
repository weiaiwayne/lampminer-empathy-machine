The flickering fluorescent lights of the DMV hummed a discordant tune, a fitting soundtrack to Maria’s anxiety. Her lost green card loomed larger than just a piece of plastic; it was the key to her life, the permission slip to exist without fear in this land. Two years. Two years the USCIS agent had said, a casual death sentence to her freedom.

She remembered the coyote’s face, etched with a predatory calm as he accepted the deed to their family’s small adobe house. A house filled with generations of memories, now collateral for a debt she couldn't possibly repay. Her supervisor at the refugee center had said it was outside their purview, a polite way of saying “not our problem.” But the fear in Maria’s eyes haunted her.

Reddit threads became her scripture, a chaotic collection of anxieties and glimmers of hope. H1B visas, F1 students, asylum seekers – a digital Babel of voices all yearning for stability. Each story, a testament to the desperation and resilience of the human spirit, mirrored her own struggles in some small way.

Today, she was helping a young Afghan man, fresh off the plane, navigate the labyrinthine process of applying for asylum. He spoke little English, his eyes wide with a mixture of fear and hope. She remembered that look. She’d seen it in the mirror a thousand times. She tried to reassure him, drawing on the fragmented knowledge she’d gleaned from Reddit threads and the quiet strength she found in her faith.

“God is good,” she told him, her voice thick with the weight of her own uncertainty. “Even when we don’t understand His plan.”

She prayed for him, for Maria, for all those caught in the tangled web of immigration laws. The words of Romans 13 echoed in her mind: “Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established.” But how could she reconcile that with the blatant injustices she witnessed every day?

Maybe, she thought, her role wasn’t to understand God’s plan, but to be a small flicker of light in the darkness, a hand reaching out to those who were lost and afraid, guided by the unwavering belief that even in the face of seemingly insurmountable obstacles, grace could still prevail. And that grace, she hoped, would extend to her own desperate plea for a life of peace and belonging.
