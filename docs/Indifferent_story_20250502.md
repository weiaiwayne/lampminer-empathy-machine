Okay, lemme try and spin something out of this…

The loading icon on the USCIS website mocked me. Again. "No Submissions." Right. Like my life. The world was a glitchy app, constantly buffering, promising connection but delivering only frustration. I swiped over to Reddit, the digital water cooler where anxieties fermented into memes.

Scrolling through the immigration threads, the usual chaos. Someone's I-90 denied, marriage on the rocks, fear oozing out of every post. Another poor soul, Mom stuck in Mexico. Heartbreaking. It was like watching a slow-motion train wreck, everyone desperately grabbing at the emergency brake, knowing damn well it probably wouldn’t work.

Then came the news about the kid with cancer. Deported. A fucking *kid* with *cancer*. What kind of dystopian algorithm spat that out? It was the kind of thing that made you want to throw your phone into the nearest body of water and retreat to a cabin in the woods, but who could afford a cabin these days? And besides, the internet was a damn addiction.

Ironic, really. I was safe, relatively speaking. Green card, steady job in tech. But the threads of anxiety were still there, woven into the fabric of daily life. Was my data being harvested? Would some algorithm flag me as a "potential threat?" Did it even matter if I was a productive member of society? The digital panopticon saw all, judged all, and dispensed its arbitrary justice with the cold efficiency of a machine.

Maybe the Caracalla dude had the right idea. Citizenship for everyone. A radical reset. But that was Rome, and this was… well, this was now. And now was a never-ending stream of bad news, bureaucratic nightmares, and the gnawing feeling that no matter how hard you worked, how much you contributed, you were always just one wrong click away from digital oblivion.
