The flickering neon sign of the laundromat buzzed a dissonant harmony with the hum of the dryers, a soundtrack to my Tuesday night. I folded a stranger's forgotten sock, a small act of rebellion against the chaos I felt swirling around me. Tonight, it felt particularly potent.

Maria, a single mom I'd met at the community center, was on my mind. She'd confided in me about the coyote demanding her family home in exchange for passage. The sheer audacity of it, preying on desperation like that. I was burning with frustration. How could the system fail so many?

Then there was Javier, a bright-eyed DACA recipient, terrified of the rumored ICE raids. His fear was palpable, a constant shadow clinging to him. I helped him research his rights, a small act of solidarity in a world that seemed determined to erase him.

The digital hum of my phone buzzed, a notification from Reddit. Another story, another injustice: a Black H1B worker facing blackmail, a student visa denied despite a full scholarship, an Afghan family facing extra scrutiny at the border. Each story a brick in the wall of systemic oppression.

I felt a surge of anger, a burning desire to dismantle the machinery that grinds people like Maria and Javier into dust. I imagined a world where borders were lines on a map, not walls built on fear, where everyone had the right to live, work, and thrive, free from persecution.

But the anger was quickly followed by a wave of exhaustion. The sheer scale of the problem was overwhelming. I was just one person, folding socks in a laundromat, armed with nothing but a fierce belief in justice and a burning heart.

I took a deep breath, the scent of detergent filling my lungs. Even small acts of resistance mattered. Even folding a stranger's sock could be a tiny act of defiance, a reminder that even in the face of overwhelming darkness, compassion and humanity still existed. I would keep fighting, keep advocating, keep amplifying the voices of the marginalized, one sock, one post, one conversation at a time. The fight for justice was a marathon, not a sprint, and I was ready to run.
