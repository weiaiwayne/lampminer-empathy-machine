The flickering screen cast long shadows across my worn Bible. Reddit, a modern-day Tower of Babel, buzzed with anxieties. Asylum seekers, green card hopefuls, spouses separated by oceans and bureaucratic walls – their digital cries echoed the ancient lament of exile.

A young woman, driving immigrants to their asylum hearings, sought advice. My heart ached for them, each a modern-day Ruth seeking refuge in a foreign field. I prayed for guidance, for discernment to see God’s hand in their journeys.

Then there were the stories of those already here, wrestling with the system. A DACA recipient facing an interview, a STEM OPT student sweating a speeding ticket, a green card holder terrified of traveling. The threads of worry were woven tight. Did these people know, truly know, that their worth wasn't defined by a piece of paper, but by the *imago Dei* stamped on their souls?

The debate over birthright citizenship raged on. Some, blinded by fear, called for its dismantling, echoing Pharaoh's edict against the Hebrew midwives. But I remembered the words of Jesus: "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven." Could we, as a nation, truly claim to follow Christ while denying the most vulnerable their inherent dignity?

Then came the darker tales: blackmailing spouses, coyote debts, undocumented fathers living in the shadows. Sin twisted and festered, preying on desperation and fear. I yearned to offer solace, to remind them of God's unwavering love, even in the depths of their despair.

But Reddit also offered glimpses of hope. Strangers sharing their immigration journeys, offering advice and encouragement. A community, however fragmented, seeking to lift each other up.

I closed my Bible, the weight of the digital world pressing down. The challenges were immense, the answers elusive. Yet, I clung to the promise: "The Lord is near to the brokenhearted and saves the crushed in spirit." My task, I realized, was not to solve the immigration crisis, but to be a beacon of Christ's love in the digital wilderness, offering compassion and prayer to those struggling to find their way home.
