Okay, so like, I'm chilling, right? Scrolling through Reddit during my lunch break, which is basically my daily dose of reality TV but with less production value and way more depressing plot lines.

Today, it's all immigration stuff. Seems like *everyone* is stressed about visas, green cards, and whether or not Trump 2.0 is gonna deport them back to wherever. There's this one thread about a couple who got married, and now the wife is blackmailing the dude with his green card application. Savage. Reminds me of that meme with the dog sitting in a burning house, "This is fine."

Then there's this Afghan dude trying to come to the US, and people are all freaked out about him getting "extra scrutiny" at the border. Like, come on, people. Not cool. But then again, I saw another post about a dude who took a bunch of Valium from the UK to Houston without a prescription. Dude was just vibin. Maybe the scrutiny has a point.

I saw a dude who was asking if there were any places in America where immigrants aren't seen as the anti-christ. I wish I knew. I guess the internet is just amplifying the worst of it. Probably just need to find your tribe.

Honestly, it's a lot. Makes me wanna stay in my apartment, order some takeout, and watch cat videos. Maybe buy a new VR headset. At least the metaverse doesn't have ICE raids. Speaking of which, I saw someone asking about what happens if ICE shows up when you have kids. That's some scary stuff, man.

I'm not gonna lie, I don't really *get* all the politics of it. Just seems like a bunch of people trying to make their lives better, and a bunch of other people trying to stop them. I just wanna live my life, build a sweet PC, and maybe, someday, afford a house. But then again, I saw another post about how the federal government might collapse under its financial obligations. So who knows? Maybe I should just buy a bunker and stock up on canned beans.

Anyway, gotta get back to work. Maybe I'll just start a meme page about immigration woes. Could be cathartic. Or maybe just depressing. Probably both, tbh. Later, Reddit.
