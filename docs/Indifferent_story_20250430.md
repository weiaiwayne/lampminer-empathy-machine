The meme scrolled by, a Pepe the Frog with a tiny American flag, captioned "Just waiting for my GC." I chuckled, then felt a pang. Seen that one a thousand times. Immigration, amirite? A lottery ticket glued to a Kafka novel.

My phone buzzed with a CNN alert: *NOLA ICE deports 4 y.o. US citizen with CANCER*. Jesus. The kid’s a citizen. What kind of twisted logic… I swiped it away. Too heavy.

Later, I'm browsing Reddit, seeing people asking about green card delays, visa denials, and the sheer, soul-crushing bureaucracy of it all. One thread was about a woman who couldn't return to California after going to her father's funeral in Mexico. Another, about a father scared for his safety in the US because of his tattoo. Each story a tiny, sharp shard of anxiety.

I saw one about a couple with a big age gap who are worried about their marriage being scrutinised. That's a classic Reddit story. I think, "Good luck to them. Love is love. If it makes them happy, who cares?".

I thought about the Caracalla article I'd seen earlier. Rome giving out citizenship like candy. Now? Fortresses built of paperwork, fear, and arbitrary rules. Progress? More like a glitchy update.

I ordered a new VR headset. Need to escape. The real world is just too much. The grind of the 50-60-hour workweek, the HCOL, the political theater. Better to jack in, explore digital landscapes, blast some aliens. Maybe that's the future: everyone just living in the metaverse, no borders, no ICE, just customizable avatars and endless memes.
