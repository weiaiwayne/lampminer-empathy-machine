Okay, so, like, birthright citizenship, right? I saw some dude on Reddit saying it's gonna bankrupt the US. I dunno, seems a little extreme, but whatever. I'm more worried about my internet speed dropping when my neighbor fires up his crypto rig.

Anyway, this got me thinking. Picture this: Neon-drenched food truck, parked right on the border, blasting reggaeton. Inside, a dude named Miguel is flipping plantain pancakes, slinging 'em to the masses. He's got a drone delivering extra napkins, because, you know, efficiency.

On one side of the truck, people are paying with crypto wallets, arguing about NFT values. On the other, they're bartering with chickens and handmade blankets. It's a total free-for-all, capitalism on overdrive.

But here's the kicker: Miguel doesn't care about any of that. He's just trying to make a living, you know? He's got a family back home, needs to upgrade his drone, and dreams of opening a second food truck.

Then, these border patrol robots roll up, all sleek and chrome, scanning everyone's biometric data. They're programmed to enforce some new law about citizenship, but they can't quite figure out Miguel's pancakes. Are they food? Are they a form of currency? Are they a threat to national security?

The robots start glitching, their algorithms overloaded. They just stand there, buzzing, while Miguel keeps flipping pancakes, the smell of caramelized plantains filling the air. People are laughing, taking selfies with the confused robots. It's chaos, but it's also... strangely beautiful.

See, that's America, right? A mess of contradictions, fueled by hustle and dreams, with a side of existential dread. And whether you're born here or not, you're just trying to navigate the glitching robots and get your damn pancake. Now, where's my phone? Gotta post this on Insta.
