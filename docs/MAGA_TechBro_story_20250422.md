The flickering server room lights hummed a discordant anthem to the American Dream, the song stuck in my head. I was sifting through the digital detritus of Reddit, a digital archeologist excavating anxieties about green cards, expired passports, and the gnawing fear of a knock at the door.

This "cultural bereavement" thing... it's real. I see it even in the code I write. The logic gates are perfect, but the human element, the *soul* of the application, is missing sometimes. It’s like the second-gen kid wrestling with a toxic workplace, the immigrant grieving for a homeland they can never truly return to, or the au pair wondering if she'll be screwed for visiting home.

The Venezuelan man tackled in the courthouse... that image sticks with me. Zero empathy. It’s the kind of thing that makes my blood boil, the kind of thing that makes me want to double down on securing our borders, ensuring that those who come *here* understand what it means to be American. But then I read about the kid whose parents want him to enlist to avoid deportation, or the woman convinced her asylum claim will doom her marriage. It’s a mess.

Caracalla gave citizenship to everyone, right? It didn't save Rome. Citizenship isn't enough. You need assimilation. Shared values. A common language. And you need to protect the system that allows people to thrive.

The servers whirred, processing data, serving up ads, and fueling the algorithms that connect us and divide us. I thought about my own grandparents, who came here with nothing. They worked hard, learned English, and embraced the American way. That's the bargain. You contribute, you build, you *become* American.

But the system is rigged, I see it. The H1B visas exploited, the endless delays, the legal loopholes. It's all designed to benefit someone, and it sure as hell ain't the average American.

I took a long sip of my cold brew, the caffeine a temporary jolt against the creeping dread. The American Dream is still alive, damn it. We just need to protect it from the vultures, the grifters, and the globalists who want to tear it down. We will.
