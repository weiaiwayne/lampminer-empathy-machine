The flickering neon sign of the "American Dream Diner" cast a sickly yellow glow on the rain-slicked street. Inside, Maria scrubbed furiously at a stubborn coffee stain, her knuckles white against the chipped Formica. Her daughter, Sofia, a bright spark dimmed by worry, was hunched over a textbook, prepping for her citizenship test. Maria, a legal resident for twenty years, felt a familiar knot tighten in her stomach.

Outside, a black SUV idled, its tinted windows reflecting the diner's glow like predatory eyes. Maria knew that look. Fear, a constant companion, whispered in her ear. The news, the whispers in the community, the sudden deportations, it all painted a terrifying picture.

Sofia looked up, her brow furrowed. "Mama, what's 'civic duty'?"

Maria paused, the damp rag clutched in her hand. "It's...it's what you do for your country, Sofia. Voting, helping others, being a good person." She forced a smile. "Like you, studying hard."

But the words felt hollow. How could she tell Sofia that even with citizenship, with all the "civic duty" in the world, they might still not be safe? The news stories of naturalized citizens facing deportation for long-past, minor infractions haunted her. The goalposts were always shifting, the rules rewritten on a whim.

A bell above the door jingled, announcing a new customer. Maria's heart skipped a beat. A man in a dark suit, his face obscured by the shadows of the diner's entrance. He scanned the room, his gaze lingering on Sofia.

Maria straightened her shoulders, a primal protectiveness rising within her. This was her home, her daughter's home. She would not let fear paralyze her. She would fight, scrub, and pray, and somehow, she would keep her family safe in this land that promised so much, yet demanded so much more. The diner bell jingled again, and Maria steeled herself. Another customer, another unknown. Another day in the American Dream.
