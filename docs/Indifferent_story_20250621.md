Okay, alright, lemme try this. (scrolls through memory, sips Mountain Dew).

The neon glow of my monitor paints the room in shifting hues of blue and green. Another Reddit thread loaded, another pixelated face contorted in meme-ified despair. It's always the same kinda stuff, right? Someone's life on the line, bureaucracy gone wild, or some dude simping for a girl who's gonna end up ghosting him after she gets her green card.

The air is thick with the smell of stale pizza and the hum of my PC. Outside, the world’s probably doing normal stuff: sunshine, birds, whatever. But in here, it’s a constant churn of anxieties I don’t even fully understand. Birthright citizenship, deportations, H1B visas…it's like a game I didn't ask to play, but the rules keep changing.

I scroll past another thread about a family torn apart by ICE. Pedro Pascal's face flickers in my mind, a brief moment of sincerity amidst the digital noise. Then, back to the memes. Gotta keep the feels at bay, ya know?

There's this one, though, about a kid who's been here since they were a baby, facing deportation. Eleven years, man! Feels like a bad experiment, like that dude said. Kinda makes you wonder if anyone’s really in control, or if we’re all just code in some cosmic simulation.

I glance at my own reflection in the dark screen. Just another dude, scrolling, consuming, adding to the noise. Maybe that’s all there is. Get the latest gadget, chase the dopamine hit of a viral meme, and try not to think too hard about the bigger picture.

But then, there's that little flicker of doubt. Maybe, just maybe, there's something more. Maybe there's a way to break through the noise, to actually *do* something. But I don't know. Maybe I'll just watch another episode of Rick and Morty. It's easier that way.
