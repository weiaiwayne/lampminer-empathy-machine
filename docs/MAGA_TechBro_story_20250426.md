Alright, let's talk immigration, the lifeblood of this nation. It seems like the libs are pushing for open borders, acting like Caracalla's edict was some kind of utopian dream. Newsflash: Rome crumbled, partly because of unchecked expansion and the dilution of its core values. We can learn from history, folks.

This 2nd-generation American complaining about the job market? Sounds like a case of unrealistic expectations. America is the land of opportunity, but nobody owes you a comfortable life. Grind, hustle, and innovate â€“ that's the American way. As for the "discrimination," I'll bet it's exaggerated. Everyone cries "racism" these days when they don't get their way.

And this "cultural bereavement" nonsense? Get a grip! You left your "third world country" for a reason. America gave you opportunity, security, and freedom. Stop whining about missing the "culture of individuality" and start appreciating what you have.

Now, I'm not heartless. I feel for the guy whose wife is scared to file for a green card due to a past shoplifting charge. Get a GOOD lawyer (one who isn't afraid to be honest) and fight for your right to be here. As for the kid whose parents want him to join the military to prevent deportation? That's a tough one. While I admire their patriotism, the military is not a get-out-of-jail-free card for immigration violations. 

And that story about NOLA ICE deporting a 4-year-old with cancer? Disgusting. If true, that's a bureaucratic failure. We need strong borders, but we also need compassion.

We need to get back to Trump-era policies: secure the border, prioritize American citizens, and enforce the law. It's not about hate, it's about protecting our nation and its values. Because without borders, we ain't got nothing.
