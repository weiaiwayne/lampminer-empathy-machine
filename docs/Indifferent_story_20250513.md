The feed glowed, another endless scroll of digital anxieties. Deported horses, families torn apart, visa denials that tasted like ash in the mouth. I swiped. New phone drop next week, finally USB-C. Priorities, right?

A headline caught my eye: "Stress-Free Work Environment." LOL. Like that's ever gonna happen. Elon chasing political power after all that money? Dude needs a hobby. Maybe pottery.

My brain, already fried from doomscrolling, tried to process it all. Green cards, asylum seekers, threatened deportations, lawyers charging exorbitant fees. It was a tangled mess of human hopes and bureaucratic nightmares, all filtered through the lens of Reddit cynicism.

I thought about the South Africans getting refugee status. Weird flex, Trump. Then, a mother-in-law in Texas, weaponizing immigration status against her own family. The stuff of daytime TV, but real.

A meme popped up: "Me trying to adult." Accurate. This whole immigration thing felt like a complex puzzle with missing pieces, and I was just holding a half-eaten bag of chips.

I swiped again. A thread about dual citizenship. "Stuck in Cuba, help!" Shit. This whole mess is giving me anxiety.

Maybe I should just build a gaming PC instead. Distraction is key. But a nagging feeling lingered: these weren't just headlines. These were people, lives, futures, all caught in the gears of a system I barely understood. I'd just be a consumer and not care about the world around me.

I closed Reddit. Too much. Needed a palate cleanser. Maybe a cat video. Or that new tech review. But before I did, the words of one of the posts struck me: "If you’re satisfied with what you have, you’re richer than those so-called ‘successful’ people.”

Easier said than done, but then, so is solving the world's problems. Now, where's that cat video?
