The scent of woodsmoke and desperation clung to the air outside the church. Inside, the fluorescent lights hummed a discordant tune above the anxious faces of the congregation. Brother Elias, his brow furrowed with concern, adjusted his spectacles, the worn Bible in his hands feeling heavier than usual.

Lately, Reddit had become a strange, secular oracle. He’d seen the threads, the anxieties woven into digital tapestries: the Afghan husband arriving alone, the mother stuck in Mexico, the DACA recipient fearing the knock on the door. Each post a whispered prayer, a plea for understanding in a world that seemed increasingly hostile.

He thought of Maria, a bright young woman from El Salvador, her asylum interview looming. He’d been helping her prepare, coaching her through the legal jargon, reminding her to hold onto the hope promised in Romans 8:28. But the weight of the world, the relentless tide of political rhetoric, threatened to drown even her faith.

Then there was young Samuel, a bright-eyed boy whose father, a skilled mechanic, lived in the shadows, fearing deportation. Samuel dreamed of becoming a doctor, a beacon of healing in a broken world. But the threads on Reddit spoke of birthright citizenship under threat, of families ripped apart, of dreams deferred indefinitely.

Elias felt a pang of guilt. He, a citizen by birth, could offer little more than platitudes and prayers. He could point them to scripture, to the unwavering love of God, but the tangible anxieties remained. The questions about visas, waivers, and legal loopholes swirled in his mind, a constant reminder of his own inadequacy.

He closed his eyes, seeking solace in the familiar words. "The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want." But even as he recited the psalm, the faces of his flock, etched with worry, lingered in his mind. He knew that faith alone wouldn't solve their problems, but perhaps, just perhaps, it could offer a glimmer of hope in the gathering darkness, a reminder that even in the face of earthly trials, God's grace endures. He knew he needed to do more than pray. He needed to act. He needed to find answers, to connect them with resources, to be a true shepherd, not just a preacher. The digital oracle had spoken. Now, it was time for the church to respond.
