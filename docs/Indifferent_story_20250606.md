Okay, so like, immigration stuff is all over Reddit, right? Seems messy. People stressed about interviews, visas expiring, and getting deported. Some of it sounds kinda messed up, like that woman whose ex is still around even though he's supposed to be gone. And that dude whose wife is blackmailing him, that's just sad.

I saw one post about a dude asking if he'd get denied for a minor mistake in his medical exam? Like, chill out, man. It's probably fine. But then you read about people getting denied for seemingly no reason, like that doctor in Brazil who just wanted to visit Vegas, and it makes you wonder what's up.

Birthright citizenship, that's a hot topic, I guess. Some people are all for it, others think it's gonna bankrupt the country. Personally, I don't really care. Just seems like another thing for people to argue about online.

Honestly, all this immigration talk makes me wanna stick to my memes and tech reviews. It's too complicated and depressing. I'm just tryna live my life, ya know? Upgrade my phone, watch some funny videos, maybe hit up a food truck. Politics are a headache.
