Okay, here's my take on the world after scrolling through Reddit all day.

The notification pinged: "New PS6 Leaks!" Finally, something to distract from the existential dread. But even the sleek renders of the next-gen console couldn't fully drown out the background hum of anxiety.

See, I saw this post about some dude's greencard taking forever. Then another about a woman who can't become a citizen because she's illiterate in *two* languages. Like, damn, talk about a glitch in the system. Makes you wonder what the point of all this striving is.

Then there's the article about the emotional toll of moving to a new country. Cafes and yoga retreats? Sounds bougie. But I get it. You're supposed to find your 'third place,' right? But what if your third place is just your phone, doomscrolling Reddit while eating instant ramen?

It's like that Roman emperor, Caracalla, giving everyone citizenship. Sounds good on paper, but did it actually *solve* anything? Did it make people feel like they belonged? Probably just created more paperwork and taxes.

Even this second-gen immigrant is complaining, despite speaking perfect English. I guess the American Dream is just a high-res meme at this point.

And that poor kid scared Trump's gonna deport his dad. I bet it's not just the politics, but the fear of your family being ripped apart. The world's unfairness is not a bug, it's a feature.

I think I need a nap. Maybe I can dream about a world where the PS6 is readily available, everyone has universal healthcare, and nobody's afraid of being deported. But I doubt it. More likely, I'll dream about Elon Musk buying Reddit and turning it into a Dogecoin farm. Now *that's* a nightmare.
