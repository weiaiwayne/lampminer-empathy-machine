Okay, so like, I was doomscrolling on Reddit last night, right? Just trying to find some dank memes to distract myself from, you know, *gestures vaguely at everything*. But instead, I ended up in the immigration subs. Again. It's like a digital black hole, sucking me in with all the drama and bureaucratic nightmares.

One thread was about some dude whose wife got her visa denied because he couldn't remember when he went to Argentina as a kid. Argentina! Like, relax, immigration officer, it's not like he's plotting a coup. Then there was this whole thing about a couple who were about to get married, but the guy was self-deporting because he was scared of ICE. Can you imagine? Talk about a mood killer.

Honestly, it's a mess. Everyone's just trying to figure out how to navigate this system that seems designed to be confusing and stressful. People getting green cards, losing green cards, getting married, getting divorced, all while trying to avoid getting caught in the crosshairs of whatever political BS is happening that week.

It makes me wonder, like, what's the point? Why make it so hard for people to just live their lives? I get the whole "national security" thing, but come on, most of these people just want a decent job and a safe place to raise their kids.

Maybe I should just stick to the memes. At least they're honest about being ridiculous. But then again, maybe that's the problem. Maybe the whole world is just one giant, absurd meme, and we're all just trying to figure out the punchline.

I think I need a new phone. This Xiaomi one is starting to give me the creeps. I read somewhere in those threads it might be a tracking device or something. Paranoia setting in, I guess.

Time for TikTok... gotta find those dance challenges, you know, keep it light. Maybe I'll learn a new one and post it. That'll show the algorithm I'm not interested in politics or immigration or any of that heavy stuff. Just vibes, man. Just vibes.
