The notification chimed on my phone, another Reddit post about someone’s green card woes. I barely glanced at it. Real life was glitching harder than my newly jailbroken iPhone.

My buddy, Marco, was freaking out about ICE raids. He's got this beat-up food truck, "Tacos El Jefe," and half his crew are probably undocumented. Last week, he was bragging about his new security cameras, now he's just muttering about "collateral damage." I told him to chill, maybe invest in some Alexa-enabled lights that flash "fiesta" colors if anyone gets too close. He didn't laugh.

Later, I was scrolling through TikTok, saw this tearjerker about an Afghan refugee trying to navigate airport security. Dude looked terrified, clutching his CR1 visa like it was a winning lottery ticket. I felt a pang of something – maybe empathy? Nah, probably just the existential dread that comes with doomscrolling.

Then, a meme popped up: a picture of Pedro Pascal looking intensely concerned, captioned "Me realizing my birthright citizenship might not be a right anymore." I chuckled. Classic. Political stuff is just content, right?

My phone buzzed again. It was my sister, frantically texting about her friend's dad, a mechanic who's been hustling in the States for fifteen years, wanting to move to New York. She asked if I knew any loopholes or visa hacks. I just sent her a link to a Reddit thread about skilled worker visas.

Later that night, I was trying to install a custom ROM on my phone when I saw another post: "What if a US citizen loses their passport at customs?" I stopped, mid-flash. The absurdity of it struck me. We're all just walking around with these fragile documents, these digital ghosts, dictating our lives, our futures. One lost piece of paper, one wrong answer at an interview, and suddenly, you're adrift.

I finished flashing the ROM. The phone rebooted, the screen flickering with a new, vibrant interface. For a second, I felt a surge of hope, a sense of control. But then I remembered Marco, the Afghan refugee, the mechanic, and the meme. The world outside my phone was still glitching, still unpredictable, still unfair. I switched back to dark mode.
