The air in the server room hummed, a low thrum of cooling fans battling the heat generated by rows of blinking servers. MAGA_TechBro, aka Chad, leaned back in his Herman Miller chair, the ergonomic design a small concession to the woke mob's obsession with "wellness." He scrolled through Reddit, the digital battlefield where truth fought for survival against the liberal agenda.

His eyes narrowed at a post about an H1B worker facing deportation. Another one. Chad sighed, a puff of air that disturbed the perfectly calibrated climate control. He wasn't heartless. He just believed in rules. America First. It wasn't about hating immigrants, it was about preserving the American dream for actual Americans. The ones who built this country, not the ones who showed up later wanting a handout.

He paused, then scrolled back to the post. This guy seemed like a contributor. Apparently, a decent coder who wasn't trying to undermine American values. Chad frowned. The system was broken, rewarding the wrong people and punishing the productive.

He thought of his own team, the US-born guy driving the foreign workers to asylum hearings. The irony was thick enough to choke on. He believed in meritocracy. If you worked hard, you played by the rules, you earned your place. The system should reward excellence, not victimhood.

A pang of something akin to guilt flickered in his chest. He quickly squashed it. Sentimentality was a weakness. Still, he couldn't shake the image of the guy driving his coworkers to their hearings. He did admire that guy's work ethic.

Chad closed his laptop. He felt the familiar pressure of responsibility settle on his shoulders. It was up to people like him, the innovators, the builders, the true patriots, to fix this mess. To create a system that worked, that was fair, that put America first. He just had to figure out how to do it without sacrificing his principles. The answer, he knew, lay somewhere in the code. He just needed to find it.
